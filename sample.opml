						<outline text="- - - - - - -"/>
						<outline text="BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA"/>
						<outline text="A PROCLAMATION"/>
						<outline text="As Americans, we strive for a Nation of broad-based prosperity, where hard work pays off and everyone can go as far as their dreams allow. Over the past half-century, women have opened up vast horizons for themselves and their daughters. Yet many still work harder for less, and because of gender inequality in areas like health care, they have had to stretch paychecks further to make ends meet. During National Women's Health Week, we recommit to expanding women's access to care, fighting discrimination, and advancing the opportunity agenda."/>
						<outline text="The Affordable Care Act (ACA) prohibits insurers from charging women higher premiums simply because of their gender. Insurance companies can no longer discriminate against women due to pregnancy, or deny coverage because of pre-existing conditions. Thanks to the ACA, women can receive preventive services like contraceptive care, recommended cancer screenings, and annual well-woman visits at no out-of-pocket cost. And this year, millions of women signed up for affordable coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace while millions more gained insurance through the expansion of Medicaid. To learn more about resources available to women and girls, visit www.HealthCare.gov, www.WomensHealth.gov, or www.GirlsHealth.gov."/>
						<outline text="As we continue to implement this law, my Administration remains dedicated to protecting women's rights to make their own health care decisions. The past few years have seen an orchestrated and historic effort to roll back these basic rights. States have enacted laws aimed at banning or severely limiting the right to choose and introduced legislation that would cut off access to common forms of birth control. Together, we must reject policies that aim to turn back the clock."/>
						<outline text="This week, let us uphold the principle of equality in health care. Let us affirm that women alone -- not insurance executives, not politicians, and not their bosses -- have the right to make decisions about their own health."/>
						<outline text="NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 11 through May 17, 2014, as National Women's Health Week. I encourage all Americans to celebrate the progress we have made in protecting women's health and to promote awareness, prevention, and educational activities that improve the health of all women."/>
						<outline text="IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand fourteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-eighth."/>

						<outline text="NATIONAL SMALL BUSINESS WEEK, 2014"/>
						<outline text="- - - - - - -"/>
						<outline text="BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA"/>
						<outline text="A PROCLAMATION"/>
						<outline text="Small businesses represent an ideal at the heart of our Nation's promise -- that with ingenuity and hard work, anyone can build a better life. They are also the lifeblood of our economy, employing half of our country's workforce and creating nearly two out of every three new American jobs. During National Small Business Week, we renew our commitment to helping these vital enterprises thrive."/>
						<outline text="From day one, my Administration has been focused on cultivating an environment where small businesses can succeed. During my first term, we added 18 direct tax breaks for small businesses, including new tax credits for hiring unemployed workers and veterans and for investing in new equipment. Through the Small Business Administration (SBA), we have supported hundreds of thousands of loans. And to ensure small businesses have a voice in economic decisions, I elevated the Small Business Administrator to a Cabinet level position."/>
						<outline text="My Administration is also working to ease burdens on businesses. We cut in half the time it takes for the Federal Government to pay small business contractors, freeing up more resources for growth. To provide a boost to the smallest new businesses, we have eliminated SBA fees on loans under 150,000 dollars and waived fees for veterans who take out loans under 350,000 dollars. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, it is now easier for small business owners to purchase quality health insurance, and they are now eligible for tax credits that cover up to half of the cost of providing coverage for their employees. And we continue to implement patent reforms that are reducing the application backlog, protecting American intellectual property abroad, and helping entrepreneurs roll out their inventions sooner."/>
						<outline text="Yet we have more work to do. In the years to come, we must protect tax credits that help small businesses hire and add incentives for paying workers higher wages. We must ensure entrepreneurs -- even those who are not rich -- have the resources to take their businesses to the next level. Because if we create a more level playing field, the best ideas will rise to the top, opportunity will flourish, and America will prosper."/>
						<outline text="NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, dohereby proclaim May 12 through May 16, 2014, as National Small Business Week. I call upon all Americans to recognize the contributions of small businesses to the competitiveness of the American economy with appropriate programs and activities."/>

						<outline text="PEACE OFFICERS MEMORIAL DAY AND POLICE WEEK, 2014"/>
						<outline text="- - - - - - -"/>
						<outline text="BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA"/>
						<outline text="A PROCLAMATION"/>
						<outline text="Each year, America sets aside a week to salute the men and women who do the difficult, dangerous, and often thankless work of safeguarding our communities. Our Nation's peace officers embody the very idea of citizenship -- that along with our rights come responsibilities, both to ourselves and to others. During Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week, we celebrate those who protect and serve us every minute of every day, and we honor the courageous officers who devoted themselves so fully to others that in the process they laid down their lives."/>
						<outline text="As we mourn the fallen, let us also remember how they lived. With unflinching commitment, they defended our schools and businesses. They guarded prisons; patrolled borders; and kept us safe at home, on the road, and as we went about our lives. To their families, we owe an unpayable debt. And to the men and women who carry their mission forward, we owe our unyielding support."/>
						<outline text="Our Nation has an obligation to ensure that as police officers face untold risks in the line of duty, we are doing whatever we can to protect them. This means providing all necessary resources so they can get the job done, hiring new officers where they are needed most, and investing in training to prepare those on the front lines for potentially deadly situations. It also means making reforms to curb senseless epidemics of violence that threaten law enforcement officers and haunt the neighborhoods they serve."/>
						<outline text="Just as police officers never let down their guard, we must never let slide our gratitude. We should extend our thanks not only in times of tragedy, but for every tragedy averted -- every accident avoided because a patrol officer took a drunk driver off the streets, every child made safer because a criminal was brought to justice, every life saved because police officers raced to the scene. In other words, we must show our gratitude every day."/>
						<outline text="By a joint resolution approved October 1, 1962, as amended (76 Stat. 676), and by Public Law 103-322, as amended (36 U.S.C. 136-137), the President has been authorized and requested to designate May 15 of each year as &quot;Peace Officers Memorial Day&quot; and the week in which it falls as &quot;Police Week.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 15, 2014, as Peace Officers Memorial Day and May 11 through May 17, 2014, as Police Week. I call upon all Americans to observe these events with appropriate ceremonies and activities. I also call on Governors of the United States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, officials of the other territories subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, and appropriate officials of all units of government, to direct that the flag be flown at half-staff on Peace Officers Memorial Day. I further encourage all Americans to display the flag at half-staff from their homes and businesses on that day."/>

						<outline text="AND NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION WEEK, 2014"/>
						<outline text="- - - - - - -"/>
						<outline text="BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA"/>
						<outline text="A PROCLAMATION"/>
						<outline text="In today's global economy, first-class jobs gravitate to first-class infrastructure. A sound transportation system allows businesses to safely move their goods to market, and maintaining that system creates jobs upgrading ports, unclogging commutes, and repairing roads and rails. During National Defense Transportation Day and National Transportation Week, we underscore the importance of infrastructure to our economy, security, and way of life."/>
						<outline text="This summer, the Congress will need to protect more than three million jobs by finishing transportation and waterways bills that provide at least 4 years of funding for extensive infrastructure repairs and investments. Because accessible roads, safe bridges, and good jobs should transcend politics, I am hopeful our representatives will do right by the American people. In the meantime, I am taking executive action to slash bureaucracy and streamline the permitting process for key projects. Earlier this year, I launched a competition for 600 million dollars in transportation grants. Cities and States can win this funding by creating plans that both modernize transportation infrastructure and stimulate the economy."/>
						<outline text="Infrastructure also plays a vital role in America's security. Fluid, dependable, and efficient transportation systems allow first responders and service members to swiftly arrive on the scene of an emergency. When natural disasters strike, we rely on these systems to bring food and first aid to victims. In order to safeguard our Nation, we must ensure our infrastructure is resilient enough to withstand disaster and keep supply lines open."/>
						<outline text="Today, America has ports that are not prepared for the next generation of supertankers. We have more than 100,000 bridges that are old enough to qualify for Medicare. And we have a world-class labor force ready to tackle this challenge. Let's put them to work."/>
						<outline text="In recognition of the importance of our Nation's transportation infrastructure, and of the men and women who build, maintain, and utilize it, the Congress has requested, by joint resolution approved May 16, 1957, as amended (36 U.S.C. 120), that the President designate the third Friday in May of each year as &quot;National Defense Transportation Day,&quot; and, by joint resolution approved May 14, 1962, as amended (36 U.S.C. 133), that the week during which that Friday falls be designated as &quot;National Transportation Week.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Friday, May 16, 2014, as National Defense Transportation Day and May 11 through May 17, 2014, as National Transportation Week. I call upon all Americans to recognize the importance of our Nation's transportation infrastructure and to acknowledge the contributions of those who build, operate, and maintain it."/>

						<outline text="BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA"/>
						<outline text="A PROCLAMATION"/>
						<outline text="For over a century, Americans have come together to celebrate our first friends and mentors, our inspirations and constant sources of strength. Our mothers are breadwinners, community leaders, and pillars of family. They pioneer scientific discoveries, serve with valor in our Armed Forces, and represent our Nation in the loftiest halls of Government. Whether biological, adoptive, or foster, they play a singular role in our lives. Because they so often put everything above themselves, on Mother's Day, we put our moms first."/>
						<outline text="Through centuries of organizing, marching, and making their voices heard, mothers have won greater opportunities than ever before for themselves and their children. Their victories brought our Nation closer to realizing a sacred founding principle -- that we are all created equal and each of us deserves the chance to pursue our own version of happiness."/>
						<outline text="Today, there are more battles to win. Working mothers increasingly provide the majority of their family's income, yet even now, discrimination prevents women from earning a living equal to their efforts. My Administration is proud to fight alongside women as they push to close the gender pay gap, shatter glass ceilings, and implement workplace policies that do not force any parent to choose between their jobs and their kids. Because when women succeed, America succeeds."/>
						<outline text="By words and example, mothers teach us how to grow and who to become. They shape lasting habits that can lead to healthy living and lifelong learning. They demonstrate what is possible when we work hard and apply our talents. Without complaint, they give their best every day so they and their children might achieve the scope of their dreams. Today, let us once again extend our gratitude for our mothers' unconditional love and support -- during years past and in the years to come."/>
						<outline text="The Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 8, 1914 (38 Stat. 770), has designated the second Sunday in May each year as &quot;Mother's Day&quot; and requested the President to call for its appropriate observance."/>
						<outline text="NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 11, 2014, as Mother's Day. I urge all Americans to express love and gratitude to mothers everywhere, and I call upon all citizens to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities."/>

						<outline text="The song, ''Rise Like a Phoenix,'' helped Wurst '-- the alter ego of 25-year-old Thomas Neuwirth '-- secure Austria's second victory in the competition. The country also won in 1966."/>
						<outline text="''This is dedicated to everyone who believes in a future of peace and freedom,'' a tearful Wurst said as she accepted the trophy from Denmark's Emmelie de Forrest, who won the contest last year. ''We are unity and we are unstoppable.''"/>
						<outline text="Pushing the boundaries of gender identity is nothing new at Europe's annual song contest '-- an extravaganza known for its eclectic, sometimes unlistenable lineup of techno beats, love songs and pop tunes. But Wurst had been faced with some protests before the competition, highlighting a rift between Europe's progressive liberal side and the traditional values and nationalist rhetoric of Russia and some other nations taking part."/>

						<outline text="JEREMY HOBSON, HOST:"/>
						<outline text="This is HERE AND NOW from NPR and WBUR Boston. I'm Jeremy Hobson."/>
						<outline text="And now for some news about us, NPR, that is. Today, the network named a new president and chief executive officer, 62-year-old Jarl Mohn will take over on July 1st and will be the fifth person to hold that job on either an interim or permanent basis in just five years. NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik joins us now for more on this. David, welcome back."/>
						<outline text="DAVID FOLKENFLIK, BYLINE: Hey, thanks so much, Jeremy."/>
						<outline text="HOBSON: Well, first, just tell us what you can about Jarl Mohn and his background."/>
						<outline text="FOLKENFLIK: Well, I literally just stepped out of studio with him to step in to this studio with you on the line. He's a very commanding, charismatic guy. He's kind of a media innovator and creator. He helped found the E! Entertainment Network. He was one of the top first executives, MTV and VH1. He's been involved also on the boards of XM Satellite Radio and of comScore, which is, you know, helps to measure digital traffic."/>
						<outline text="So a guy who's thought a lot about broadcasting, about entertainment, and about traffic and how audiences respond. One of the first things I said to him was, you know, what do you bring from those endeavors? And said, well, one of the things I really understand are the expectations of audiences and the importance of living up to your mission."/>
						<outline text="NPR's a very different mission than E! TV. We're not doing reality radio, if you will. You know, I'm not going to change what NPR is good at and what people expect of it. But I am going to try to deliver even better on that promise."/>
						<outline text="HOBSON: And how is he being received so far by NPR's member stations? There's long been this conflict about how NPR can move forward, especially with digital stuff when the bread and butter does come from all the member stations."/>
						<outline text="FOLKENFLIK: Well, that's right. A significant portion of NPR's revenue comes from fees for the programs, primarily MORNING EDITION, ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, but some others as well, that the member stations pay. And as a result, member stations are both clients and insofar as member station executives hold 10 of the 17 seats on the governing board of directors, they are also the bosses of NPR, and it means that we're really system rather than a top-down network. And that has its strengths, but it also has a lot of sort of multi-faceted arguments and debates about things."/>
						<outline text="One thing that I can say about Mohn is as well as being a benefactor of a number of cultural institutions throughout southern California where he lives, he's also been a board member of KPCC, that's Southern California Public Radio. It's one of our largest, most-influential member stations."/>
						<outline text="And he's, for the last two years call it, been the chairman of the board there. And he's really tried to help them cultivate and reinforce their intention of serving as a civil space for news and information, exchange of ideas, even so far as going to help them come up with one of their recent marketing slogans that he thinks helps reinforce not just their brand, but their mission, and that brand is: No rant, no slant."/>
						<outline text="HOBSON: Right."/>
						<outline text="FOLKENFLIK: A slogan he thought of going down the escalator while he was going to pick up his bags at the airport."/>
						<outline text="HOBSON: I've seen that on billboards around Los Angeles, David. But, let me ask you, just in the minute we have left, do you think he'll last because every CEO seems to get snapped up by somebody else and leave within a short period of time."/>
						<outline text="FOLKENFLIK: Well, he's committed to a five-year contract. I asked him that very question not minutes ago. And his answer is, look, I don't need a job. I mean, he's a very wealthy man. He doesn't need to do anything right now. And he's taking this job because he says he believes in this. He thinks that there's opportunity to help wildly increase NPR's revenues and to share those revenues with the member stations in a way that inspires greater collaboration rather than greater tensions."/>
						<outline text="HOBSON: NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik on the news today that NPR has appointed a new president and CEO. It is Jarl Mohn. He will start on July 1st. David, thanks so much."/>
						<outline text="FOLKENFLIK: You bet."/>
						<outline text="ROBIN YOUNG, HOST:"/>
						<outline text="So Amanda Beland didn't get the job."/>
						<outline text="HOBSON: I guess she did not. She's our intern."/>
						<outline text="YOUNG: And Amanda's our intern. She's graduating from Emerson Sunday with a master's, so Jarl Mohn look out."/>
						<outline text="HOBSON: Maybe he can give her a job now, or at least starting July 1st. Amanda, we wish you the best of luck. This is HERE AND NOW."/>

						<outline text="SO.....  I was in the North of Cameroon from 2005 to 2007. I worked in the villages of Tchevi, Bourrah and the town of Mokolo which sit right up against the Nigerian border. The claim that the hostages are being held in a &quot;remote&quot; region on or over the border is BS.... I have traveled the P1 road between Mokolo and Baléré and know that the whole area is basically bare assed rock as the forests have been totally razed for firewood (this being why I was there as a forester... to replant). "/>

						<outline text="Now to my main point on the whole thing.... more than one local notable told me that oil had been found in the area south of Tchevi around Ibango village which is close to the Nigerian border. This was prospected in 2004 and I heard this in 2005."/>

						<outline text="Boko Haram V. Nigeria's Crooks"/>
						<outline text="By Eric Margolis"/>
						<outline text="May 10 2014 &quot;ICH&quot; - The kidnapping of some 200 girls in northern Nigeria has sparked world outrage. It's a perfect media sensation: exotic locale and remarkably nasty kidnappers from a northern rebel movement, Boko Haram."/>
						<outline text="I've long been a connoisseur of Third World nasties, starting way back in the 60's with Haiti's voodoo chief, Papa Doc. Most have been nobodies who achieved instant international prominence by shooting off their mouths, making lurid threats and committing some dramatic outrage."/>
						<outline text="The latest is Boko Haram's chief, a certain Abubakar Shekau. This lunatic has become a world bogeyman by kidnapping the school girls, gleefully prancing in front of TV cameras, and vowing to sell them into marital slavery."/>
						<outline text="Howls of fury erupted from leftist women's groups in the US, and from President Barack Obama's liberal warrior women, Susan Rice and UN ambassador Susan Powers. Hillary Clinton lost no time in jumping on this vote-winning issue."/>
						<outline text="In a truly heartwarming gesture, China says it will send ''specialists'' to aid the hunt for the missing girls. This is really about China's race for Africa's resources and its growing competition there with the US and Europe. The US wants its troops there before the Chinese arrive."/>
						<outline text="Few people anywhere cared much about the thousands of Afghan villagers just buried alive by a monster mud slide. Even fewer that Boko Haram's previous rampages in northern Nigeria have killed over 1,500 civilians. Or that the thuggish Nigerian army and police's brutal reprisals killed thousands of Muslim villagers."/>
						<outline text="Few outraged westerners knew that stealing girls is a traditional pastime in sub-Saharan Africa and child brides are second only to cattle rustling. There was no understanding in Washington that the tribal chaos and bloodshed now seething in South Sudan is merely a continuation of traditional raiding for cattle and women between rival Dinka and Neuer tribes. Washington failed to take this into account when it engineered the breakup of Sudan to create South Sudan as an oil-rich US vassal state."/>
						<outline text="American foreign policy reacts to oil and gas as my cats do to catnip. Now, under the pretext of deep concern for the missing schoolgirls, the US and Nigeria's former colonial master, Britain, are rushing intelligence agents and special forces to this vast nation of 170 million, Africa's largest."/>
						<outline text="Faux humanitarian missions are the rage for western intervention in the Third World. Libya and Syria offer vivid recent examples. US special forces are now operating out of Djibouti and Uganda in east Africa, ostensibly hunting fanatics of the Lord's Resistance Army, a bunch of drug-crazed primitives hiding in dense forests. The US air base in Djibouti is being expanded to accommodate 4,000 military personnel and more attack drones."/>
						<outline text="Nigeria is Africa's leading oil and gas producer. Over 40% of its exports go to the United States, supplying 10% of America's energy needs. Nearby Angola has become another major energy supplier to the US."/>
						<outline text="Nigeria has important mineral and farming assets. Yet it remains mired in the deepest, shameful poverty. One percent of the population controls all the wealth and steals billions annually. In fact, the UN estimates almost all of Nigeria's vast oil wealth has been stolen, squandered or stashed in Switzerland. Oil revenues flow directly to the government, then to powerful state governors. The only thing that trickles down to Nigerians is rain."/>
						<outline text="Northern Nigeria, mostly Muslim, is dirt poor. Oil wealth goes to the better off Christian south. The north's Hausa and Fulani peoples have bitterly resented the massive theft of the nation's resources by the more nimble southerners favored by British colonial rule. In fact, Britain was at fault for creating the multi-ethnic mess that is Nigeria, another colonial Frankenstein state, like Iraq or Burma."/>
						<outline text="Boko Haram's rampage must be seen in this context, a popular uprising against Nigeria's limitless government corruption, poverty, and resource theft. Boko uses the idiom of Islam but there is nothing Islamic about it. As in other parts of the Muslim world, reformers call for imposition of Islamic law as an antidote to endemic corruption of governments and courts that has been too often fostered by Western colonialism."/>
						<outline text="Screaming ''Islamic terrorism'' won't defuse Nigeria's coming explosion. Considered one of the world's most corrupt nations, Nigeria has to clean up its act '' and fast."/>

						<outline text="This, however, was not the Nigerian town of Chibok last month when members of the militant Islamic group seized at least 276 girls from a government-run school. Nor was it Waraba, the village where eight more were taken last week."/>
						<outline text="It was Gombe, another town in Nigeria's north-east. Yet, unlike the other two cases, this incident was barely reported '' either internationally or by the rest of the country. That is because it happened in the months preceding the schoolgirls' kidnap, when Boko Haram's outrages were not only largely ignored by the world but by Nigeria itself."/>
						<outline text="Isiaka, who witnessed another Boko Haram raid in Borno and fled with his family to Nigeria's capital, Abuja, vividly recalls how communities like his are left to the militants. The attack resulted in his parents, many friends and his wife's father being killed."/>
						<outline text="&quot;They come in groups, heavily armed,&quot; he said. &quot;They are well organised and come out in their hundreds shouting and chanting, 'God is Great'. They go to their operations driving convoys of new cars and trucks without interruption from anybody."/>
						<outline text="&quot;[Boko Haram] have their own doctors and engineers in their camps, and a fuel station. They operate like their own government. They steal our animals and food from our farms. Any house they go into, they first of all take valuable items and food stuff before they kill and destroy the place they're attacking."/>
						<outline text="&quot;They attack for several hours, and they do it unchallenged. They always take some youths back to the forests [where they are based] with them. They initiate them by giving them water mixed with charms. Those that refuse to join them are shot.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="The incidents were not alone in barely registering on the Nigerian psyche. Already this year Boko Haram had snatched 25 girls from another school in Borno, and days later 42 male students were killed as their dorm rooms were set on fire while they slept. Neither generated national outrage."/>
						<outline text="Until the events of recent weeks, deeply held religious, ethnic, economic, linguistic, cultural and geographic differences created an invisible barrier between the terrorised communities and the rest of Nigeria. Boko Haram was seen as a &quot;Northern problem&quot;, not least as the popular stereotype of a Northern Nigerian being an illiterate Muslim is deeply ingrained in the national psyche despite the large communities of native Christians of varying tribes living in places such as Yobe, Adamawa, Gombe and Borno."/>
						<outline text="Lack of pictures or video reports from the terrorised areas meant what was occurring there was easier to ignore, especially as casualty figures were regularly under-estimated. There was also no centralised system for reporting the missing, with little internet coverage in the region, no specialised crime-scene investigation, and no government release of the number of dead, meaning that estimates were often based on the number of bodies seen by journalists, who had arrived after many corpses had already been removed."/>
						<outline text="For many Nigerians it was this previous indifference that explains Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan's tardy response to the schoolgirls' kidnapping. &quot;In all honesty the Govt [sic] never had any intention of doing anything about the abducted girls, just like every other attack. #BringBackOurGirls,&quot; was one typical recent tweet."/>
						<outline text="That has now, finally, changed, as witnessed by the demonstrations and social-media campaigns across the country in support of the schoolgirls. &quot;We cannot continue to live in the delusion that 'It can't happen to us!'&quot; said social-media activist and educator Japheth Omojuwa. &quot;The Nigerians who die in [the north-east] daily are not less human than those in Abuja. We need to stop thinking it is a northern problem.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="President Jonathan has vowed that the abducted girls will be found, and warned that Boko Haram's actions will lead to the &quot;end of terrorism&quot; in the country, not least due to the international outcry over the kidnappings. General Chris Olukolade, spokesman for the Defence Headquarters, said yesterday that Nigeria's army has posted two divisions to hunt for the schoolgirls, stationed in the border region close to Chad, Cameroon and Niger to work with other security agencies."/>
						<outline text="UK and US experts are now on the ground assisting the search. A spokesman for the Foreign Office said the UK team &quot;will be considering not just the recent incidents but also longer-term counter-terrorism solutions to prevent such attacks in the future and defeat Boko Haram&quot;."/>
						<outline text="Michelle Obama, the First Lady, yesterday used the weekly address issued by the White House to further increase the international pressure by saying that both she and her husband, President Barack Obama, &quot;can only imagine the anguish [the kidnapped girls'] parents are feeling&quot;."/>
						<outline text="Mrs Obama called the &quot;unconscionable act&quot; the work of &quot;grown men attempting to snuff out the aspirations of young girls&quot;. She went on to commend the courage of the parents who allowed their daughters to attend school and, in a sentiment retweeted by many in Nigeria, said &quot;education is truly a girl's best chance for a bright future&quot;."/>

						<outline text="Brig. Gen. Chris Olukolade, Nigeria's top military spokesman, left, speaks to people at a demonstration calling on the government to rescue the kidnapped school girls of a government secondary school Chibok, outside the defense headquarters in Abuja, Nigeria, on May 6, 2014."/>
						<outline text="President Goodluck Jonathan faces a credibility crisis among Nigerians as long as more than 200 girls kidnapped by Islamist extremists remain missing, even as investors affirm confidence in his country."/>
						<outline text="International political and business leaders attending the World Economic Forum ending today in the capital, Abuja, including Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI) Chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal, condemned the Boko Haram Islamists that seized the women and pledged continued investment in Africa's biggest economy. Jonathan welcomed the support, describing it as ''a major blow'' to terrorism, yet pressure is mounting from the populace to secure the captives' freedom."/>
						<outline text="''Barring a rescue of the abducted women, Jonathan's standing will deteriorate,'' Philippe de Pontet, an Africa analyst at Eurasia Group, said in an e-mailed note to clients yesterday. ''The political implications are damaging for the Jonathan administration, which has been seen as ineffective in its response.''"/>
						<outline text="Abubakar Shekau, the leader of Boko Haram, which means ''western education is a sin'' in the Hausa language, has claimed responsibility for the April 14 abduction of 276 girls from their dormitories in Borno state in the northeast. He has threatened to sell the girls in ''markets'' and marry them off, helping galvanize a global campaign to free them joined by U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama and Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai."/>
						<outline text="Protest MarchesThe U.S. security team which will assist in the search and rescue operation has arrived in Nigeria, U.S. Embassy Public Affairs officer Rhonda Augustus-Ferguson said by phone from Abuja today. She gave no details about the size or composition of the team. A team from the U.K. has also arrived, the British High Commission in Abuja said in a statement."/>
						<outline text="France and China also plan to send security personnel and other unspecified support to the West African nation to help locate the students, some of them as young as 15. As many as 53 of the students may have escaped on their own, according to community and school leaders."/>
						<outline text="In Nigeria there have been protest marches in major cities, including Abuja, the commercial capital Lagos, and the southern oil hub of Port Harcourt, urging the government and the security forces to do more to rescue the girls. Critics have accused the government of being tentative and uncoordinated in its response after the military first said it had rescued most of the girls and then retracted the statement after the school principal disputed it."/>
						<outline text="With Jonathan struggling to deal with the abductions and elections due in February, the militants ''are likely to become more active over the next year, with the hope of disrupting and/or affecting the outcome,'' Marc Chandler, an analyst at London-based Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co., said yesterday in an e-mailed note."/>
						<outline text="'Political Bump'In the first three months of the year, Boko Haram's insurgency in northeastern Nigeria has left 1,500 people dead, more than half of them civilians, according to Amnesty International. Boko Haram in the past few years has increasingly targeted teachers and students, and more than 50 schools were attacked, partially destroyed or burnt down between July last year and January in Borno state, Unicef says. More than 300 people were killed in a May 5 attack by suspected insurgents on the town of Gamboru, near the border with Cameroon, according to local officials."/>
						<outline text="''President Jonathan has failed to show the kind of leadership that would unite the country and give him a political bump from the widespread outrage directed at Boko Haram,'' said de Pontet. ''Instead, much of that outrage has shifted to the administration itself, giving the opposition an opportunity to hit the president on his already-suspect national security credentials.''"/>

						<outline text="Around midnight on February 13, a young Nigerian man named Femi* was jolted out of his evening prayer by shouting outside his window. A crowd of some 40 people had gathered around his house. &quot;No more homosexuals in Gishiri!&quot; they yelled, referring to Femi's neighborhood within Nigeria's capital city, Abuja. The mob broke down his door and dragged him outside in his boxers. They beat him and about 13 other gay men that night with broken furniture, machete handles, sticks, and a garden rake, vowing to kill them if they didn't clear out of the neighborhood. "/>
						<outline text="The attack, andother acts of vigilante violence targeting gays and lesbians around the country, was motivated by a new anti-gay law that Nigeria's president signed January 7. The measure, modeled off the one that Uganda enacted in late February, levies harsh prison sentences on anyone who makes a &quot;public show&quot; of a &quot;direct&quot; or &quot;indirect&quot; same-sex relationship or supports an LGBT organization (10 years), and anyone who attempts to enter into a same-sex marriage (14 years), even though this would be virtually impossible in Nigeria. The anti-gay backlash the law has provoked in Nigeria has led not just to violence, but to homelessness, unemployment, harassment, and a steep drop-off in HIV/AIDS treatment. "/>

He's a human rights program officer atthe International Center for Advocacy on Rights to Health (ICARH), an HIV intervention organization based in Abuja. To find out what life is like for Nigeria's gay community under the country's new law'--and what gay Ugandans are starting to face'--I visited withAdeniyi during a recent trip to Nigeria. "/>
						<outline text="&quot;All the [Gishiri] victims are presently homeless,&quot; Adeniyi told me, explaining that Femi and the other victims are afraid to return to their homes, lest their neighbors make good on their pledge to kill them. &quot;Including me. I cannot go back to Gishiri village.&quot; After the attack, members of the mob spray-painted homophobic slogans on the homes of residents suspected of being gay."/>
						<outline text="Four of the residents who were attacked that night subsequently lost their jobs after their employers discovered their sexuality, according to several victims. Chukwuemeka*, a 22-year-old living with HIV, used to work as a cashier. He was fired after the February mob attack, and he now spends his nights in a roadside auto repair shack. Femi owns a clothing boutique, but now he is afraid to go back. &quot;Next week the bank will start calling me,&quot; he says, referring to an overdue payment he owes on a 100,000 Naira (about $600) loan he took out to start his business."/>
						<outline text="As in most African countries, homosexuality has been illegal in Nigeria since the British colonial era, but convictions were rare. Nigerians used to be generally tolerant of LGBT people in their midst, even if they were homophobic, Adeniyi says, but the new law'--imposing harsh penalties for homosexuality'--has stirred up a wave of anti-gay sentiment in the deeply religious country. &quot;People already knew that people were gay,&quot; he says. &quot;Now, what we have seen is tenants threatening other tenants, saying, 'I'm going to expose you. I know what you do.''...Now they can call the police and get people convicted.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="And since the law does not define who is gay and who is not, the police and the general public are making the determination themselves, sparking witch hunts around the country. Adeniyi says that the head of the police department where Gishiri victims were held overnight after the attack, told them he knew they were gay, citing several arbitrary characteristics: &quot;He said, 'You, because you wrote down you're a hairdresser, you must be gay'...The two of you, because you guys live together, you have to be gay.' He talked to one other, and said, 'I'm sure you picked up a gay personality because you schooled abroad.'&quot;"/>
						<outline text="&quot;After they passed the bill into law'--wow. It's hell in Nigeria. Nobody wants to see you. When you walk, they say, 'Why are you walking like this? Are you a gay?'&quot;"/>
						<outline text="In addition to discrimination and harassment, Nigeria's new law has already led to a sharp decline in HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention in a country that has the second highest HIV rate in the world. About 3.4 million Nigerians are infected and some 17 percent of the gay population has the disease. The anti-gay law discourages people from seeking treatment for fear that doing so could out them as gay, and it also criminalizes organizations that serve the LGBT community."/>
						<outline text="Adeniyi estimates that since the law took effect in January, the number of patients coming into ICARH for HIV treatment has dropped by over 50 percent. &quot;One person told me he would rather die'...than come to the organization&quot; and risk imprisonment, he says. He adds that LGBT couples living with HIV may also be discouraged from going to the doctor for couples counseling, out of fear that the doctor may turn them over to the police."/>
						<outline text="Eight organizations that provide HIV treatment and prevention services in northern Nigeria have cut back on HIV outreach, training, and education programs, according to Dorothy Aken'Ova, executive director of Nigeria's International Center for Reproductive Health and Sexual Rights (INCRESE). &quot;People thought, 'You know what? I don't want to be in prison because I'm providing treatment for these gay homosexual people,'&quot; Adeniyi says. He expects more organizations will drop their programs in the coming months."/>
						<outline text="ICARH has had to scale back, too. The group has halted outreach events designed to encourage people to get tested due to concerns that the authorities might interpret this as an effort to aid the gay community. &quot;Since the law has been passed, we are doing counseling and testing, but we have suspended outreaches.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="UNAIDS, a United Nations program to combat HIV/AIDS, and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malariahave warned the new law could hinder progressin the fight against HIV/AIDS in Nigeria. In late January, the US Ambassador to Nigeriasaid the law might impede US efforts to help Nigeriafight the epidemic. Even social scientists have been scared off from taking stock of HIV trends in Nigeria'--data that can improve the response to the epidemic'--until the government can assure researchers that they will be exempt from punishment under the law, says Aken'Ova of INCRESE."/>
						<outline text="The anti-gay crackdown in Nigeria and Uganda is part of a broader trend in Africa, where at least seven other African countrieshave recently moved to tighten their anti-homosexuality laws. In many cases, lawmakers in these countries have been spurred to action by American anti-gay activists and the Christian right, who in some cases stoked fears of homosexuals preying on African children. US evangelicals have had a hand in anti-gay legislation and constitutional reform measures in Nigeria, Uganda, Namibia, Malawi, Kenya, Liberia, Zambia, Rwanda, and Zimbabwe."/>
						<outline text="Thanks to their efforts, life for more and more gay Africans is beginning to look like Chukwuemeka's. &quot;After they passed the bill into law'--wow. It's hell in Nigeria,&quot; he says. &quot;Nobody wants to see you. When you walk, they say, 'Why are you walking like this? Are you a gay?'&quot;"/>

						<outline text="BAUCHI, Nigeria: British experts arrived in the Nigerian capital Friday to help find at least 276 girls being held by Islamic militants in northeastern Nigeria as an international effort began taking hold."/>
						<outline text="They landed in Abuja as Amnesty International said Nigeria's military had advanced warning of the April 14 attack but failed to take immediate action."/>
						<outline text="''Damning testimonies gathered by Amnesty International reveal that Nigerian security forces failed to act on advance warnings about Boko Haram's armed raid on the state-run boarding school in Chibok which led to the abduction,'' the rights group said."/>
						<outline text="The British experts were expected to work closely with U.S. officials and agents in the search for the missing girls, the British government said as Boko Haram militants continued to stage attacks in northeastern Nigeria."/>
						<outline text="China and France have also promised help and the deputy prime minister of Spain, Soraya Saenz de Santamaria, told reporters in Madrid Friday that her government had decided to make available a specialist team from the police to assist, if Nigeria approves."/>
						<outline text="Britain said its aim was not only to help with the current crisis but to defeat Boko Haram."/>
						<outline text="''The team will be considering not just the recent incidents but also longer-term counterterrorism solutions to prevent such attacks in the future and defeat Boko Haram,'' the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office said in a statement Friday."/>
						<outline text="A local government official confirmed that the Islamic extremists bombed a bridge linking the town of Gamboru to the Borno state capital, Maiduguri, the headquarters of the Nigerian military offensive. Gamboru was attacked Monday by Boko Haram, leaving many dead. Estimates of the death toll from that attack ranged from 100 to as many as 300."/>
						<outline text="Communications with the remote town are difficult and it was not immediately possible to reconcile conflicting accounts of when the bridge was bombed. One account said Monday while another said Thursday."/>
						<outline text="The bombing of the bridge would prevent army convoys reaching Gamboru while leaving the way open for the insurgents to escape across a strategic bridge into neighboring Cameroon '' a bridge leading into mountains where the militants are known to have hideouts in caves."/>
						<outline text="The mass kidnapping of the schoolgirls has focused the world's attention on Boko Haram and on their many civilian victims."/>
						<outline text="Boko Haram, which wants to impose Islamic law in Nigeria, abducted more than 300 girls from a school in the northeast town of Chibok. The government of Borno state, where Chibok is located, Thursday identified 53 girls who escaped, potentially subjecting the girls to stigma in this conservative society."/>
						<outline text="The government said in a statement received Friday that the 53 girls it identified by name included those who fled the day they were kidnapped and those who escaped from Boko Haram camps days later."/>
						<outline text="Borno's government did not explain the decision to name the girls."/>
						<outline text="Jonathan Friday said that he believed the schoolgirls were still in the country and had not been moved to Cameroon."/>
						<outline text="''There are stories that they have moved them outside of the country. But if they move that number of girls to Cameroon, people will see, so I believe they are still in Nigeria,'' Jonathan told journalists on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in the Nigerian capital."/>
						<outline text="Amnesty said it had verified the information about the abduction with ''credible sources.''"/>
						<outline text="'' Amnesty International has confirmed '... that Nigeria's military headquarters in Maiduguri was aware of the impending attack soon after 7 p.m. on April 14, close to four hours before Boko Haram began their assault on the town,'' the group said."/>
						<outline text="The military, however, could not assemble the troops needed to suppress the attack, ''due to poor resources and a reported fear of engaging with the often better-equipped'' Islamists, according to Amnesty."/>
						<outline text="The 17 army personnel based in Chibok were overpowered by the attackers and had to retreat, the London-based group further said."/>
						<outline text="''The fact that Nigerian security forces knew about Boko Haram's impending raid, but failed to take the immediate action needed to stop it, will only amplify the national and international outcry at this horrific crime,'' said Netsanet Belay, Amnesty International's Africa Director for research and advocacy."/>

						<outline text="Amnesty said the military was told of the impending attack as early as 7pm. Warnings were repeated through the evening but reinforcements failed to reach the town until the next day, long after the raid and the abductions."/>
						<outline text="Amnesty said: ''An inability to muster troops '' due to poor resources and a reported fear of engaging with the often better-equipped armed groups '' meant that reinforcements were not deployed to Chibok that night.''"/>
						<outline text="Civilian patrols in the nearby village of Gagilam were said to be among the first to report the presence of a large group of unidentified armed men on motorcycles.

						<outline text="DetailsPublished on Friday, 09 May 2014 16:34Published by Linda LarbieHits: 91The international oil companies (IOCs) are expected to divest over 20 oil blocks with not less than 4 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe) per day and a monetary value of about $11.5 billion before the end of 2014, the minister of petroleum resources, Mrs Diezani Alison-Madueke, has said."/>
						<outline text="The IOCs led by Shell, Total, Agip, Chevron and ConocoPhillips have since 2010 been divesting from their oil blocks, a situation attributed to issues being addressed under the protracted Petroleum Industry Bill."/>
						<outline text="The minister spoke while delivering a keynote address with the theme 'Assets Divestment in Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry: Opportunities and Challenges' at the ongoing 2014 Offshore Technology Conference (OTC) in Houston, Texas, USA."/>
						<outline text="She said that already the total assets divestment by the IOCs has hit about 2.2 billion BOE of hydrocarbon reserves at an estimated monetary value of at least $5 billion."/>
						<outline text="'By the end of this year, the total number of blocks that are likely to be divested is estimated to exceed 20 with not less than 4 billion BOE and a monetary value of about $11.5 billion,' she said."/>
						<outline text="Alison-Madueke however dismissed fears that the spate of divestment would lead to crisis in the nation's oil and gas industry."/>
						<outline text="For her, the divestment campaign by the majors is only changing the onshore corporate landscape and creating brownfield opportunities for upstream players looking to enter the Nigerian upstream space."/>
						<outline text="The minister maintained that the divestments signify a shift in the IOCs' strategy towards the offshore which now accounts for at least 60 per cent of Nigeria's total production."/>
						<outline text="According to her, the divestment has created an opportunity for participation in the industry by the Nigerian private sector."/>
						<outline text="She said that despite the divestment, the IOCs still remain very present in Nigeria with Shell still retaining ownership in 34 onshore blocks."/>
						<outline text="Giving reasons for the divestment, the minister said 'the fact is that a number of these IOCs are moving into the more challenging frontiers in the deep offshore and are leaving the onshore blocks which they consider less profitable'."/>
						<outline text="'In addition, some of them have been sitting on oil blocks and have allowed the acreages to go fallow for years without significant development,' she added."/>

						<outline text=""/>
						<outline text="The kidnapping of over 200 Nigerian school girls, and the massacre of as many as 300 civilians in the town of Gamboru Ngala, by the militant al-Qaeda affiliated group, Boko Haram, has shocked the world."/>
						<outline text="But while condemnations have rightly been forthcoming from a whole range of senior figures from celebrities to government officials, less attention has been paid to the roots of the crisis."/>
						<outline text="Instability in Nigeria, however, has been growing steadily over the last decade - and one reason is climate change. In 2009, a UK Department for International Development (Dfid) study warned that climate change could contribute to increasing resource shortages in the country due to land scarcity from desertification, water shortages, and mounting crop failures."/>
						<outline text="A more recent study by the Congressionally-funded US Institute for Peace confirmed a &quot;basic causal mechanism&quot; that &quot;links climate change with violence in Nigeria.&quot; The report concludes:"/>
						<outline text="&quot;...poor responses to climatic shifts create shortages of resources such as land and water. Shortages are followed by negative secondary impacts, such as more sickness, hunger, and joblessness. Poor responses to these, in turn, open the door to conflict.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="Unfortunately, a business-as-usual scenario sees Nigeria's climate undergoing &quot;growing shifts in temperature, rainfall, storms, and sea levels throughout the twenty-first century. Poor adaptive responses to these shifts could help fuel violent conflict in some areas of the country.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="According to the late Prof Sabo Bako of Ahmadu Bello University, the 1980s &quot;forerunner&quot; to Boko Haram was the Maitatsine sect in northern Nigeria, whose members included many victims of ecological disasters leaving them in &quot;a chaotic state of absolute poverty and social dislocation in search of food, water, shelter, jobs, and means of livelihood.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="A year after the USIP study, Africa Review reported that many Boko Haram foot soldiers happen to be people displaced by severe drought and food shortages in neighbouring Niger and Chad. Some 200,000 farmers and herdsman had lost their livelihoods and, facing starvation, crossed the border to Nigeria."/>
						<outline text="&quot;While a good number of these men were found in major cities like Lagos, pushing water carts and repatriating their earnings to the families they left behind,&quot; said Africa Review, &quot;others were believed to have been lured by the Boko Haram.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="Indeed, one retired Nigerian security official told the journal that the Nigerian military recognised a correlation between regional climatic events, and an upsurge in extremist violence:"/>
						<outline text="&quot;It has become a pattern; we saw it happen in 2006; it happened again in 2008 and in 2010. If you remember, President (Olusegun) Obasanjo had to deploy the military in 2006 to Yobe State, Borno State and Katsina State. These are some of the states bordering Niger Republic and today they are the hotbeds of the Boko Haram.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="The other issue is Nigeria's intensifying energy crisis. In recent months, the country has faced a fuel crisis partly due to the government slashing previously high fuel subsidies, contributing to increasing public anger and civil unrest."/>
						<outline text="But while corruption and ageing infrastructure play an important role, the end of cheap oil is the real elephant in the room. One study by two Nigerian scholars concluded in 2011 that &quot;there is an imminent decline in Nigeria's oil reserve since peaking could have occurred or just about to occur; this is shown to be in agreement with previous studies.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="According to one senior Shell official in March this year, crude oil production decline rates are &quot;as high as 15 to 20 per cent.&quot; Replacing this &quot;natural production decline rate... requires more funds than is currently available.&quot; The same month, the head of Nigeria's petroleum resources department called for more investment in exploration to offset rapid decline rates:"/>
						<outline text="&quot;Oil reserves are dropping, our output is dropping too... We need to do more in this regards to have more reserves. We have reached the plateau of production in the Niger Delta and we are already going down.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="With such domestic oil production challenges undermining Nigeria's oil export revenues, the fuel subsidy slash has pushed the brunt of the crisis onto the population, escalating the poverty and inequality that is a recruiting sergeant for Islamist terror."/>
						<outline text="In northern Nigeria, where Boko Haram hail from, there is little evidence of an oil boom. With about 70% of the population subsisting on less than a dollar a day - some 20% higher than the already dismal rate in the south, rates of illiteracy and illness are endemic."/>
						<outline text="As noted by David Francis, one of the first western reporters to cover Boko Haram, &quot;Most of the foot soldiers of Boko Haram aren't Muslim fanatics; they're poor kids who were turned against their corrupt country by a charismatic leader.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="Apart from the fact that the west has been content to turn a blind eye to these problems by propping up the corrupt Nigerian government while accelerating oil and gas deals, there is a further complication."/>
						<outline text="Abundant evidence shows that al-Qaeda in the Maghreb (AQIM) have exploited the rise of Boko Haram to gain increasing control of the Nigerian militant movement."/>
						<outline text="What we're not being told, however, is that al-Qaeda's rapid expansion through northwest Africa has occurred under the rubric of Algerian state intelligence services - with US, French and British knowledge."/>
						<outline text="Our relationship with the Algerian military junta, responsible for the massacre of hundreds of thousands of civilians, is driven by the usual unquenchable thirst to access what the US energy department estimates are the world's third largest shale gas reserves."/>
						<outline text="According to Prof Jeremy Keenan, a leading Algeria expert at the School of Oriental and African Studies who advises the US State Department, European Union, and Foreign Office on regional security issues, AQIM's expansion across north Africa has focused on oil-rich regions - particularly Algeria, Niger Delta, Nigeria, and Chad; the latter three precisely where Boko Haram has reportedly received terrorist training."/>
						<outline text="Over a decade ago, Keenan reports, these countries signed a &quot;co-operation agreement on counter-terrorism that effectively joined the two oil-rich sides of the Sahara together in a complex of security arrangements whose architecture is American.&quot; The agreement evolved into the Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Initiative, which was eventually absorbed into the US Army's African Command (AFRICOM)."/>
						<outline text="Keenan argues that the west's oil and gas greed has caused our governments to turn a blind eye to the role of oil states like Algeria in fostering regional terrorism - instead exploiting the resulting chaos to legitimise efforts to consolidate access to remaining African energy reserves."/>
						<outline text="If this analysis is correct, then the hundreds of innocent girls kidnapped in Nigeria are not just victims of Islamist fanaticism; they are also victims of failed foreign, economic and security policies tied to our infernal addiction to black gold."/>

						<outline text=""/>
						<outline text="The kidnapping of nearly 300 Nigerian schoolgirls by radical Islamic terror group Boko Haram has drawn international condemnation, including that of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. "/>
						<outline text="&quot;Abominable,&quot; is how she described the kidnapping, calling it an &quot;act of terrorism&quot; that merits &quot;the fullest response possible.&quot; "/>
						<outline text="But the State Department, under Clinton's leadership, repeatedly resisted and blocked efforts to designate Boko Haram as a terrorist group. Those who pushed for the designation as early as 2011 are now saying the department missed a major opportunity to track and target the deadly organization as it grew. "/>
						<outline text="&quot;The delayed designation of Boko Haram as a Foreign Terrorist Organization cost us two years of increased scrutiny of the group's activities and leadership,&quot; Rep. Patrick Meehan, R-Pa., said Thursday in a statement to FoxNews.com. &quot;Boko Haram met the statutory requirements for the designation as early as 2011, but the State Department's delay has left us with fewer resources and less intelligence on an Islamic terrorist group with ties to al-Qaeda that is clearly destabilizing the region.&quot; "/>
						<outline text="The State Department did label Boko Haram as a foreign terrorist organization in November 2013, under the leadership of Secretary John Kerry. "/>
						<outline text="But Boko Haram had been killing people for years at that point, building ties with Al Qaeda sympathizers and orchestrating major terror attacks, including one on a U.N. compound in 2011. "/>
						<outline text="Shortly after that attack, lawmakers began lobbying the State Department to consider labeling Boko Haram a terrorist organization, to no success. "/>
						<outline text="A March 30, 2012, letter from Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., and Meehan urged Clinton to &quot;immediately designate&quot; the group, citing estimates that it had killed more than 900 people in the last two years. "/>
						<outline text="The lawmakers noted that designating Boko Haram would authorize a range of punitive measures -- giving the Justice Department clearance to prosecute those tied to the organization and the Treasury Department the ability to go after members. The letter said those in the intelligence and law enforcement community were &quot;deeply&quot; concerned about the group's &quot;rapid progression from a machete wielding mob to a full blown al Qaeda affiliate.&quot; "/>
						<outline text="Indeed, just a few months later Reuters first reported that a high-level Justice Department official had sent a letter to the State Department urging them to place Boko Haram on the terror organization list. "/>
						<outline text="The department still resisted. Further, the department reportedly lobbied Congress to stall legislation seeking the designation. "/>
						<outline text="At the time, a department official told Reuters they were &quot;very concerned&quot; about violence in Nigeria but stressed that adding a group to the list is a &quot;rigorous process which has to stand up in a court of law.&quot; "/>
						<outline text="According to The Daily Beast, State Department officials now argue there was concern at the time that putting Boko Haram on the list would raise its profile and give it &quot;greater credibility,&quot; in turn helping recruitment. "/>
						<outline text="But one unnamed former U.S. official told The Daily Beast that everyone from the FBI to the CIA was urging the department to make the call, calling Clinton's recent comments &quot;gross hypocrisy.&quot; "/>
						<outline text="Asked Wednesday why it took so long to place Boko Haram on the list, department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said she could not comment on &quot;internal decision making&quot; but noted that the eventual decision in November to designate them &quot;sends a strong message about how concerned we are about them.&quot; "/>
						<outline text="A State Department official noted Thursday that the department did designate three Boko Haram-tied individuals in June 2012, including the group's leader. This was followed, the official said, by an &quot;extensive process of review and research&quot; on possible designation of the group itself. "/>
						<outline text="&quot;After that review and consultations with the Nigerian Government and other partners, we determined that designating these groups was both appropriate and effective in helping advance our larger counterterrorism strategy,&quot; the official said, referring to the November 2013 decision. "/>
						<outline text="Timothy Furnish, an author and Islam scholar, told Fox News that the department probably was reluctant &quot;to add another group that is clearly Islamic to the list.&quot; "/>
						<outline text="&quot;Better late than never, but unfortunately where were these tweets and where was this outrage when churches were being bombed and thousands of Christians -- and other non-fundamentalist Muslims -- were being killed in Nigeria?&quot; he said, referring to a recent Clinton tweet drawing attention to the kidnappings. &quot;It would have been nice if this outrage had happened earlier.&quot; "/>

						<outline text="Pro-Russian rebels have started to cast ballots in a &quot;self-rule&quot; vote in eastern Ukraine, a move criticised by the US as &quot;illegal&quot; and which could pull the former Soviet republic apart."/>
						<outline text="Sunday's poll, carried out as two &quot;referendums&quot; in the provinces of Donetsk and Lugansk, where armed men hold more than a dozen towns, marks a serious deepening of the political crisis in the country."/>
						<outline text="Although a &quot;yes&quot; vote would likely only be recognised by Russia, it would greatly undermine a presidential election which Ukraine is to hold in two weeks time, the AFP news agency reported."/>
						<outline text="The US and the European Union see the presidential election as crucial to restoring stability in Ukraine."/>
						<outline text="In a statement released on Saturday, Jen Psaki, the US State Department spokeswoman, said the referendums were &quot;illegal under Ukrainian law and are an attempt to create further division and disorder&quot;."/>
						<outline text="&quot;If these referenda go forward, they will violate international law and the territorial integrity of Ukraine. The United States will not recognise the results of these illegal referenda,&quot; she said."/>
						<outline text="In comments posted on Ukraine's presidential website on Saturday, acting president Oleksandr Turchynov said the vote would lead to &quot;a complete destruction of the economy, social programs and general life for the majority of the population&quot;."/>
						<outline text="&quot;This is a step into the abyss for the regions,&quot; Turchynov said."/>
						<outline text="Earlier on Saturday, France and Germany jointly threatened &quot;consequences&quot; on Russia if the presidential election is scuppered - echoing US President Barack Obama's warning of automatic sanctions that would slice into whole sectors of Russia's weakening economy."/>
						<outline text="Al Jazeera's Paul Brennan, reporting from Donetsk, said voters had been asked a &quot;deliberately coy&quot; question about self-rule."/>
						<outline text="He said &quot;it does not specify what form that rule may or may not take. It is deliberately coy&quot;."/>
						<outline text="Our correspondent also said the people in the east do not like the Kiev government but they do not necessarily want to break away."/>
						<outline text="A new poll by the Pew Global Attitudes Project shows a majority of those living in Ukraine - both in the restive east and more nationalist west - want the country's borders to remain intact, said our correspondent. "/>
						<outline text="The self-rule votes and presidential election come amid intensifying violence on the ground in east Ukraine."/>
						<outline text="Troops have been battling the well-armed rebels, who have barricaded themselves in towns and cities in Donetsk and Lugansk."/>
						<outline text="Despite rebel claims that the polling will reach 90 percent of the seven million people living in these two provinces, the areas they hold account for less than half that population."/>
						<outline text="Polling stations opened in schools in rebel-held territories at 8am (0500 GMT) and will close 12 hours later, according to rebel chiefs in the city of Donetsk."/>
						<outline text="Reporting from Kiev, Al Jazeera's Kim Vinnell said the Ukrainian government had dismissed the vote as &quot;illegitimate&quot;."/>
						<outline text="However, like in Crimea - which Russia annexed in March after a similar referendum - Ukraine has been powerless to stop preparations."/>
						<outline text="The government and its Western backers accuse Vladimir Putin, Russia's president, of deploying special forces in east Ukraine, as in Crimea, to see the vote through and to sabotage the May 25 presidential election."/>
						<outline text="Putin belatedly admitted sending military forces, but not special forces, to Crimea but continues to deny militarily meddling in east Ukraine."/>

						<outline text="By IAN ALLEN | intelNews.orgFour German military observers, who were kidnapped in Ukraine by pro-Russian separatists, are members of a military agency that has intelligence contacts, but are not themselves spies, according to a leading German newspaper. The German observers were abducted along with several other Western military officials on April 25, in the eastern Ukrainian city of Sloviansk. They were participating in a military verification mission organized by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). At the time of the abduction, one pro-Russian separatist leader, Vyacheslav Ponomarev, said his group had decided to detain the OSCE monitors due to ''credible information'' that they were spies for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The OSCE strongly denied the accusation that its monitors were intelligence operatives, saying that the kidnappers' claims were aimed at damaging the reputation of the organization. With nearly 60 signatories to its charter, the OSCE has operated since 1975 with the aim of securing peace across the European continent. It regularly supplies military observers to investigate what it terms ''uncommon military operations'' in nations that formally invite their presence, as Ukraine did last month. On Monday, German newspaper S¼ddeutsche Zeitung said that, although the four German OSCE observers are not employees of German intelligence agencies, they do maintain ''certain connections'' with Germany's Federal Intelligence Service, known as Bundesnachrichtendienst, or BND. The Munich-based broadsheet claimed that the inspectors, who had been given diplomatic status during their deployment in Ukraine, are not members of staff at the BND or MAD, Germany's Military Counterintelligence Service. However, they are employed at the Verification Center of the Bundeswehr '--Germany's federal armed forces. The mission of the Center, which is based in the town of Geilenkirchen, in Germany's North Rhine-Westphalia, is to verify compliance with weapons control agreements signed between Germany and other countries. The paper said that the Center works closely with the BND, which also maintains a branch in Geilenkirchen. The article also stated that the BND regularly provides briefings for the Center's observers, who are often employed in OSCE-authorized monitoring missions. The intelligence agency provides observers with information about the security situation in host countries, as well as intelligence about the location of targeted military facilities. The OSCE observers were freed on May 3, after more than a week in captivity, and have been flown to their respective countries of origin."/>

						<outline text="Italy could increase gas imports from Algeria, Libya and the Netherlands to counter any disruption of supplies from Russia, Deputy Industry Minister Claudio De Vincenti said on Monday as G7 energy ministers gathered in Rome."/>
						<outline text="&quot;We are capable of rapidly increasing imports from the supplier countries ... Libya, Algeria and the Netherlands,&quot; De Vincenti told Reuters."/>
						<outline text="His comments came on the day G7 energy representatives began a two-day meeting to discuss energy policy after a weekend of violence killed dozens in Ukraine, a major transit route for Russian gas into the EU."/>
						<outline text="Italy, which generates more than 40% of its electricity from gas, is increasingly dependent on Russian gas as Algerian imports decline and Libyan supplies are limited by growing unrest in the country."/>
						<outline text="Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned Russia could cut off supplies to Ukraine unless it starts to pay off a gas debt, which Gazprom says stands at $3.5 billion ('¬2.5 billion)."/>
						<outline text="Rome is placing increasing importance on completing the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) to bring Azeri gas to Italy, but is also supporting the South Stream project, which will transport Russian gas bypassing Ukraine."/>
						<outline text="&quot;South Stream remains crucial. We still believe the pipe's arriving in Italy could be advantageous compared to an Austrian endpoint,&quot; De Vincenti said."/>
						<outline text="Austria's OMV agreed last week with the Russian energy giant that South Stream would be routed to the Baumgarten gas hub in Austria, outmanoeuvering Italy, which had wanted it to end in the northeastern Italian town of Tarvisio [read more]."/>
						<outline text="The Rome government wants to turn Italy into a southern European gas hub able to transit African supplies into Europe as it develops reverse flow capabilities at its northern borders."/>
						<outline text="Discoveries"/>
						<outline text="But De Vincenti said Italy was also looking at developing a gas link with the East Mediterranean, where recent gas discoveries off the coasts of Israel, Cyprus and Malta have raised hopes of fresh supplies for Europe."/>
						<outline text="&quot;It could certainly be a possibility in the future ... we'll have to see in what form, whether pipeline or liquefied natural gas (LNG),&quot; he said."/>
						<outline text="The ITGI - Interconnector Turkey-Greece-Italy - pipeline, developed by EDF's Italian unit Edison, might be a candidate for the role, he said."/>
						<outline text="&quot;The pipeline already has all the permits&quot;."/>
						<outline text="A source close to the matter told Reuters on Monday contacts had been made between the developers of TAP and ITGI to discuss possible cooperation."/>
						<outline text="De Vincenti said Italy had 3 LNG terminals that were currently under-utilised, but which could be cranked up if needed."/>
						<outline text="&quot;There are also at least three other terminals we aim to get operating in the next few years,&quot; he said."/>
						<outline text="G7 energy ministers will continue talks on Tuesday with a closed-door meeting to hammer out a proposal on energy security to be addressed to the G7 summit in Brussels in June."/>
						<outline text="&quot;We are going to discuss a full range of problems relating to energy, energy security and also the transition to new forms of energy,&quot; said French Environment minister S(C)gol¨ne Royal."/>
						<outline text="Tuesday's talks, which will also involve European Energy Commissioner G¼nther Oettinger, will address new strategies for diversifying energy supply sources as the debate over weaning Europe off Russian gas gathers pace."/>
						<outline text="European Union officials sat down in Brussels yesterday (5 May) to confront the hard choices to be made for the EU, which takes a third of its gas imports from Russia, almost half of that passing through Ukraine. "/>

						<outline text="Next month, David Cameron and other G7 leaders are expected to sign off on an ''emergency response plan'' to assist Ukraine this winter if Russia restricts gas supplies."/>
						<outline text="At the same time, G7 energy ministers this week agreed a plan to eliminate Europe's reliance on Russian oil and gas over the longer term and prevent energy security being used as political bargaining chip by the Kremlin."/>
						<outline text="Russia currently supplies around 30 per cent of all gas consumed within Europe and more than 50 per cent of the gas used by Ukraine."/>
						<outline text="In 2006, when the Russian state-controlled energy producer Gazprom turned off supplies through its Ukrainian pipeline Austria, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy and Poland reported gas pressure in their pipelines fell by 30 per cent."/>
						<outline text=" While only a small fraction of gas used by the UK comes from Russia, any restriction in supply has a dramatic impact on prices."/>
						<outline text="Under the G7 proposals, support would be given to build several new liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals across Europe, while the US would lift restrictions on the export of shale gas."/>
						<outline text="At the same time, the EU will invest in new pipelines to move gas from West to East and increase supply routes from North Africa."/>
						<outline text="Japan is also understood to be prepared to re-start some of its nuclear plants that were mothballed in the wake of the Fukushima disaster. Japan is now one of the largest importers of LNG, which has pushed up prices to record levels."/>

						<outline text="Russia will require Ukraine to pay in advance for gas starting from June, Energy Minister Alexander Novak said late on Thursday, after Kyiv failed to pay for gas deliveries.   Gazprom said on Wednesday that Ukraine's payments for gas supply in April had fallen due and that nothing had been paid, raising Kyiv's total debt for Russian gas to $3.51 billion.   &quot;According to contract... failure of obligations automatically leads to a switch to prepayment for gas deliveries for Ukraine starting from June 1,&quot; Novak said in a statement late on Thursday.   Russia had threatened to cut gas supplies to Ukraine in June if it receives no prepayment by the end of May. Gazprom supplies about 30 percent of the gas consumed in Europe, shipping about half of that via Ukraine.   Russia's Energy Ministry added that Gazprom would send a preliminary bill for June before May 16 and will ship gas in volumes reflecting payments received before May 31.   The Kremlin has often used its energy dominance as a tool of foreign policy, cutting off supplies to Ukraine and Europe in 2005 and 2009 after price disputes with an earlier pro-Western government in what became known as the &quot;gas wars&quot;.   Ukraine desperately wants to change the conditions of a 2009 contract, negotiated by an earlier pro-Western government, which locked Kyiv into buying a set volume whether it needed it or not at $485 per 1,000 cubic metres - the highest price in Europe.   Moscow dropped the price to $268.5 when ousted President Viktor Yanukovich turned his back on a trade and association agreement with the European Union but re-instated the original price after the uprising in Ukraine.   &quot;Russia can't and should no long carry the burden of support of Ukraine's economy alone, giving it discounts on the gas price and forgiving debts, in fact covering the deficit in Ukraine's trade,&quot; Novak said in a statement.   This week, Ukraine received a first tranche worth about $3.2 billion from a $17 billion two-year aid programme from the International Monetary Fund, which Moscow hopes Kyiv will use to cover gas debt.

						<outline text="Council President Herman Van Rompuy will travel to Ukraine next Monday to discuss how to stabilise the situation there before the 25 May presidential election, the EU said yesterday (8 May)."/>
						<outline text="Western countries are hoping the election will help stabilise the country. But Russia said yesterday it would be senseless to go ahead with the vote, unless the Ukrainian government ended a military operation against separatists in the east and began a nationwide dialogue on constitutional reform."/>
						<outline text="&quot;I will travel to Kyiv on Monday to continue our talks on how to stabilise the situation in Ukraine ahead of the presidential elections on 25 May, how to put an end to violence in Ukraine and how to create an inclusive national dialogue,&quot; Van Rompuy said in a statement."/>
						<outline text="Van Rompuy, who represents the European Union's 28 national governments, said Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk had invited him in a phone call."/>
						<outline text="Yatseniuk and several members of his government are already scheduled to come to Brussels next Tuesday for talks with European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso."/>
						<outline text="The EU has said it is willing to provide $15 billion ('¬11 Billion) in loans and grants to Ukraine over several years to help get the shattered economy back on its feet."/>
						<outline text="Pro-Russian separatists have taken over parts of eastern Ukraine and plan to hold a referendum there on Sunday on breaking away from Kyiv, following the example of Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in March after a similar vote."/>
						<outline text="The upheaval in Ukraine broke out after former pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovich turned his back last year on an agreement on closer trade and political cooperation with the EU in favour of a $15 billion bailout from Russia. That sparked street protests that ended with him fleeing Ukraine."/>
						<outline text="Mediators press on peace plan"/>
						<outline text="International mediators took new peace proposals to Kyiv yesterday as tension in eastern Ukraine soared with an announcement by pro-Moscow separatists that they would proceed with a referendum on self-rule on Sunday."/>
						<outline text="The draft &quot;road map&quot;, seen by Reuters, took no direct view on the referendum, which Western leaders say is illegitimate and inflammatory, but said the 25 May elections were key to stabilising the former Soviet republic. It said all sides must refrain from &quot;violence, intimidation or provocative actions&quot;."/>
						<outline text="It was drawn up by the Swiss chair of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and is aimed at giving new impetus to a deal signed in Geneva in mid-April by the European Union, Russia, Ukraine and the United States."/>
						<outline text="That accord said illegal armed groups would withdraw from places they have occupied in eastern Ukraine in a process to be overseen by the OSCE, a Vienna-based body that seeks to prevent conflict and promote democracy across Europe."/>
						<outline text="But pro-Russian separatists have shown little sign of budging from public buildings in the east and comments from Moscow and Kyiv yesterday cast further doubt over the prospects for the peace process."/>
						<outline text="The OSCE plan said Ukraine has the right to use its security forces &quot;in a proportionate manner&quot; to prevent violence in its standoff with pro-Moscow rebels and should adopt an amnesty law to cover any who end their occupation of public places in eastern areas and lay down their arms."/>
						<outline text="It said the OSCE chair &quot;offers ... to coordinate further steps to implement&quot; the Geneva deal and listed various measures the 57-nation body could help with, including mediation, disarmament, and the launch of a broad national dialogue."/>
						<outline text="The OSCE already has more than 150 civilian monitors in Ukraine. Eight European military observers from a separate OSCE-linked mission were detained by Ukrainian separatists for a week before they were freed last week."/>
						<outline text="Two pages"/>
						<outline text="The two-page Swiss plan said &quot;all acts of violence must be promptly investigated and prosecuted accordingly&quot; and that the OSCE would support such measures with a hotline and an expert team that could be operational by 15 May."/>
						<outline text="However, amnesty would be granted to &quot;protesters and those who have left buildings and other public places and surrendered weapons, with the exception of those found guilty of capital crimes&quot;."/>
						<outline text="Amnesty was also part of last month's Geneva agreement. But the OSCE proposal appeared more concrete in suggesting &quot;the immediate adoption&quot; of such a law by the Ukrainian parliament as a &quot;confidence-building measure&quot;."/>
						<outline text="One OSCE envoy said Swiss Foreign Minister Didier Burkhalter presented the plan to Van Rompuy in Brussels late on Wednesday, after Burkhalter met earlier with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow."/>
						<outline text="The OSCE press office said Burkhalter had &quot;proposed a road map with milestones and activities in order to make implementation (of de-escalation steps under the Geneva accord) more concrete, structured and effective&quot;, but it gave no detail."/>
						<outline text="Consultations were now taking place with the sides - senior OSCE officials were in Kyiv yesterday - but it was unclear when, if and in what form the proposal would be made public."/>
						<outline text="The pro-Western leaders who took over Ukraine in February after its Moscow-backed president fled to Russia amid mass protests said yesterday they would not talk to &quot;terrorists&quot; - their term for the separatists."/>
						<outline text="Russia called on the West to press Ukraine's government to talk to its foes, saying the OSCE peace proposals would have a better chance of success if the Kyiv authorities hold &quot;a truly respectful, equitable conversation&quot; with their opponents."/>
						<outline text="In a foreign ministry statement, Russia dangled the prospect of unspecified compromises on its part in exchange for such Western pressure. Moscow says Kyiv must halt a security operation in the east and hold nationwide talks on constitutional reform that the Kremlin hopes would grant more power to Ukraine's provinces and keep it out of NATO forever."/>
						<outline text="&quot;High-level round tables&quot;"/>
						<outline text="In a surprise move, Putin called on the rebels on Wednesday to postpone their planned referendum on self-rule to create conditions for dialogue between Kyiv and the east on what has become the worst East-West standoff since the Cold War."/>
						<outline text="But the pro-Russian separatists voted yesterday to hold Sunday's vote in spite of Putin's call. While the Swiss plan underlined the need to refrain from actions contrary to Ukraine's &quot;basic security interests&quot;, it did not call for any specific measures by Russia, for example regarding the troops the West says it has amassed near Ukraine."/>
						<outline text="It said OSCE monitors would help mediate between &quot;illegally armed groups&quot; and Ukrainian authorities on disarmament, release of hostages, return of seized buildings and other issues."/>
						<outline text="A broad national dialogue would cover &quot;decentralization, local self-governance, language and national minorities&quot; and other topics, the Swiss road map said, adding that a series of &quot;public high-level round tables&quot; would be launched immediately."/>
						<outline text="Ukraine's parliament &quot;is encouraged to take stock of the outcomes of the national dialogue and submit key elements for further work on the constitutional process to a nationwide plebiscite,&quot; it said."/>

						<outline text=""/>
						<outline text="Russian President Vladimir Putin plans to open the door to Chinese money as U.S. and European sanctions over Ukraine threaten to tip the economy into recession, according to two senior government officials."/>
						<outline text="The move would roll back informal limits on Chinese investment as Russia seeks to stimulate growth, said the officials, who have direct knowledge of talks and asked not to be identified as the information isn't public. The government wants to lure cash from the world's second-biggest economy into industries from housing and infrastructure construction to natural resources, they said."/>
						<outline text="The Chinese won't be welcome in all areas: Russia plans to set ''red lines'' around significant gold, platinum-group metals, diamond mining and high-technology projects, the officials said."/>
						<outline text="Putin is turning to Asia as financing from the U.S. and EU tightens and capital outflows surge amid the worst standoff since the fall of the Iron Curtain. The U.S. and the EU have accused Putin of fomenting unrest in Ukraine's easternmost regions after annexing the Crimean peninsula in March, threatening to widen the sanctions to target the economy unless Russia helps ease tensions."/>
						<outline text="Putin oversaw nationwide military drills in the run-up to today's World War II Victory Day celebrations after saying May 7 that Russia had pulled troops from the border with Ukraine, a claim that the U.S., the U.K. and the government in Kiev challenge."/>
						<outline text="Autonomy VotesPro-Russian separatists in Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions vowed to press ahead with autonomy votes on May 11 after the Russian leader urged them to postpone the plebiscites."/>
						<outline text="The International Monetary Fund said last month that Russia's economy is already in a technical recession and cut its growth forecast to 0.2 percent this year. Russia's exports of gas and raw materials are so far holding up, even in the face of international condemnation over the incursion into Ukraine."/>
						<outline text="The world's largest energy producer shipped 2 percent more gas to Europe in the first three months of 2014 than a year earlier, government data show. Diesel production for export increased, while cargoes of grains, palladium and nickel either climbed or were at similar levels."/>
						<outline text="Russia has been building trade ties with China, including long-term oil deals worth hundreds of billions of dollars, to tap Asia's biggest energy consumer as the European economy slowed. China is Russia's largest trading partner with $95.6 billion of business in 2012, followed by Germany, according to data compiled by Bloomberg."/>
						<outline text="'Clinical Fact'''It's a clinical fact'' that China is heading to become the No. 1 state in the global economy, Putin said during his annual televised call-in show on April 17. Russia will develop ties with China and the two countries' union will be a ''significant factor'' affecting the architecture of modern international relations, Putin said."/>
						<outline text="Still, the Asian country has relatively few major projects in Russia, evidence of informal restrictions on its investments, according to one of the officials. At least two government discussions are scheduled this month to set guidelines for how Chinese investors will be allowed to work in Russia, the officials said."/>
						<outline text="In addition to limiting access to precious metals and diamonds, Russia is likely to restrict China's investments in high-technology projects, the people said. The government will also look at how to bar large settlements of Chinese citizens on its territory to avoid ethnic tensions, they said."/>
						<outline text="China's OpportunityPutin's decision, coming as competition from U.S. and European financing slows, may offer China a good opportunity to gain access to Russia's economy. Joining existing resource projects will probably be more appealing than starting from scratch, Moscow-based George Buzhenitsa, a Deutsche Bank AG analyst, said by phone on May 7."/>
						<outline text="Projects such as OAO Mechel (MTLR)'s Elga coal deposit in Yakutia or Evraz Plc (EVR) and OAO Alrosa's Timir iron ore asset may be interesting to Chinese investors, Buzhenitsa said."/>
						<outline text="''Given that China has a shortage of raw materials from iron ore to coal to copper, it may be extremely interested in gaining access to such projects in Russia,'' Buzhenitsa said."/>
						<outline text="Evraz's press service and Mechel spokesman Arseniy Palagin declined to comment."/>
						<outline text="Sakhalin ProjectRussia invited China to join the Elga development, the government said on April 10 after Deputy Prime Minster Arkady Dvorkovich visited the country. Chinese cooperation on the Sakhalin-3 oil and gas project is also under consideration, the government said at the time."/>
						<outline text="China is already one of the largest investors in OAO Uralkali, the Russian potash producer, with a 12.5 percent stake. China North Industries Corp. had plans to jointly develop nickel and copper fields in Russia with billionaire Oleg Deripaska's companies, according to an initial agreement signed in 2012."/>
						<outline text="Russia is also seeking China's help to build a bridge to the annexed Crimean peninsula, Kommersant reported on May 5, citing unidentified people with knowledge of the government's plans."/>
						<outline text="Russia's relations with China are developing steadily, regardless of any other issues, and no ''special'' government meetings are being planned on China, Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said by phone on May 7."/>
						<outline text="The government will announce a tender to build a bridge across the Strait of Kerch to Crimea, with all international investors welcome to participate, Peskov said. The cost of construction is estimated to be at least 50 billion rubles ($1.4 billion), which may rise should it be decided to link the bridge to a railroad."/>

						<outline text="How we all went from Sovereign gladiator to slaveBritish MPs are expressing concern over the plans carefully hidden in the last Budget to allow future governments to withdraw funds allegedly owed to HMRC direct from citizens' bank accounts."/>
						<outline text="There is also concern being rightly engendered by 38 degrees about the obvious intention of the Coalition to sell our personal financial details to the private sector. Before that, plans within the NHS to sell patient details to the insurance sector were hastily covered up and then denied."/>
						<outline text="Last year, the citizens of Cyprus were blatantly sold to the slave drivers of the Troika'....their crime having been to help Greece pay back that same salivating trio of cannibals."/>
						<outline text="Over the last eighteen months, some 23 developed nations have been forced by one means or another to confess that they have plans in place to raid citizen funds in order to pay off bank and sovereign debt."/>
						<outline text="In Athens, sources tell me that the Troika has four times now tabled the issue of raiding private pension funds directly '' and simply never telling the proposed recipients."/>
						<outline text="Most pension pots in the Western world '' my own included '' have been illegally reduced by blatant market manipulation to change events one would otherwise have expected based on the fundamentals'...and to compound the crime, they have used our own money to do it."/>
						<outline text="In a near-sexual sense of the term, we are '' all of us, young or old, European, American, Asian, African or Australasian '' being slowly acclimatised to the idea of our wealth being interfered with, raped, assaulted and mutilated."/>
						<outline text="Time was, the citizen produced and consumed according to his or her own skills, needs and whims. We in the advertising profession (oh, how we were hated by the 1970s Stalinist Left) frequently used amusement, engagement and guile to '' nevertheless openly '' persuade such consumers that our brand was the best. And if the product behind that brand was no good, then nothing would kill it more quickly than advertising successfully generating trial'...followed by rejection."/>
						<outline text="What a lucky man I was to be part of that innocent game in which the consumer knew what we were at, and this mutual awareness was displayed clearly in advertising not afraid to pastiche itself."/>
						<outline text="But what a naive twat I was not to see how '' once the barbarians broke through the gates '' the thin end of permission to sell would become a gun to the head of those being arm-wrestled into purchase."/>
						<outline text="In just forty years '' a mere blink at the brightness of sunlight -  the consumer has plummeted from sovereign to slave. From having been the person calling the shots, the basic unit of Imperial Cistercian currency has become a slave to be prodded, abused, judged, measured up and ultimately sold in the Slave Market. This market laughingly refers to itself as neoliberal, but in reality it is a neoroman orgy of monopolies. Newscorp illegally tapped our phones, the multiple retailers pored over our personal consumption habits, the banks peered through the keyhole at our money arrangements, the media preyed upon human exhibitionism to abase us in ''talent'' contests, and the ISPs quickly became the feverish dirty-mack voyeurs desperate to know with whom we were partying, the objects of our leisure time, how often we got pissed, and who we were fucking."/>
						<outline text="All of them spy on us for the purposes of selling and control. All of them view us as slaves, too stupid to slam the door of our private lives behind us. And not an ounce of protection has come from those we elect to ensure our liberty and safety."/>
						<outline text="There's an obvious reason for this. Desperate for money they could no longer generate from voter enthusiasm, the political Parties switched from Union dues, charitythons, Village Green fetes and beetle drives to corporate, interest group, pressure group and then eventually do-what-we-say-or-die groups with no semblance of connection to '' or interest in '' the citizen."/>
						<outline text="Those who '' by non-avoidance and non-evasion of taxes, generally decent behaviour, and at times injudicious expenditure '' kept the show on the road are now become the reviled roadies and toadies required to tune up the equipment and pimp for the artists'...on pain of expulsion. No longer free agents of consumption, those loudly informed by purveyors of the American Dream fifty years ago that they were Gladiators face the threat of extinction each and every day in the Amphitheatre."/>
						<outline text="Is that not merely just, you perhaps ask. For is that not what Gladiators are for?"/>
						<outline text="I think not. Very few of us are gladiators. In metaphor rather than pedantry, the gladiatorial Spartacus figure has always been the one who quite rightly demanded more of the dictatorial State than such an unnatural body was willing to give. The Russell Crowe man is more provider than supplicant '' infinitely more Alpha than Zeta. He tells the State that he will obey it up to a point, but beyond that point it is merely in his way."/>
						<outline text="And therein lies the rub for the 21st century Western citizen. He has little or no desire to face death in the Amphitheatre. He feels irked at the idea of being a slave'....but will go along with it if the only alternative is to put his neck on the block."/>
						<outline text="It is a person's feelings about the neck/block configuration that represent the difference between the rebel and the slave."/>
						<outline text="It is the willingness to rebel that separates the user from the used."/>
						<outline text="Where are the gladiators who will order the State to stop abusing the citizen, and teach the citizen answer the State back?"/>
						<outline text="Well, I doubt very much if any of them were watching the Eurovision Song Contest last night. But one of the worst collaborators was. This is what he tweeted at the end of the show:"/>
						<outline text="Sorry to deconstruct this, but it has to be said: the people of Morley voted for this bloke. He is either a moron, or a pol on the make pretending to be as moronic as they are. Both alternatives, I'd say, are equally depressing'....but I'm 99% certain it's the latter."/>
						<outline text="Ed Balls got into Parliament by jumping the queue and being parachuted in by a Prime Minister suffering from a personality disorder. He is in his seat for two reasons: first, the use of rotten-borough tactics by Gordon Brown on a par with anything the 18th century had to offer; and second, by being sponsored by the savers and loyal supporters of the Cooperative Movement. These latter folks he sold as slaves to a couple of Hedge Funds in order to cover his fat arse, following which the Labour Party quietly moved its account elsewhere. Which is (in theory) a tricky one for Mr Balls, as he is formally a Cooperative Party MP."/>
						<outline text="But it won't bother him, because he's just another slave trader. He denies having anything to do with it now, of course; but I and a dozen other hacks could quickly produce between us twenty people who know that's bollocks. And they'd testify to that'...if they too weren't slave traders, and scared of losing the steady supply of brown envelopes."/>
						<outline text="We are, all of us, to blame for this. Because not only did we do nothing to stop it, in millions of cases we threw open our doors and invited Big Brother in. Some of us are more guilty than others '' either because we were more lazy than stupid, or because we did nothing to protect the stupid. The result of doing nothing to stop evil never changes: you get evil. Every time."/>
						<outline text="I wish more people could grow up and realise that doing nothing today only makes things worse next week. Pain avoidance '' and fluffy attempts to make a sense of responsibility look like fascism '' got us to where we are today. More on this anon."/>

						<outline text="Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda will next month sign a deal that is expected to guide the construction of the Hoima-Lokichar-Lamu crude oil pipeline, a key project that could dictate the shape the region's energy infrastructure will take."/>
						<outline text="The three countries said they will sign a Memorandum of Understanding that will bind the two implementing countries '--Kenya and Uganda '-- to ensuring the project is completed in 2017-2018 when both states are to officially start exporting crude oil."/>
						<outline text="The pipeline is expected to run 1,500km from Hoima near Lake Albert in western Uganda to Lamu port on Kenya's Coast. South Sudan is to be connected at Lokichar."/>
						<outline text="Each country will build the portion within its territory. Details from last week's Northern Corridor Integration Projects meeting in Nairobi show the three countries agreed to appoint a single transactional advisor for the project but at the same time give each country the option of choosing its own financing arrangement."/>
						<outline text="''The pipeline should be developed as a single project but split into lots and implemented within the agreed specifications and timelines'... the respective countries to ensure that any change of their priorities doesn't interfere with the construction and operation of the entire pipeline from Hoima to Lamu,'' said a ministerial report of the summit seen by The EastAfrican."/>

						<outline text="VENTURES AFRICA - LAPSSET, the Lamu Port, South Sudan, Ethiopia Transport Corridor (LAPSSET) is a flagship project of Kenya's Vision 2030, the Kenyan government's national development plan which, like Ethiopia's Vision 2025, aims to transform Kenya into a mid-level economy with10 percent annual growth."/>
						<outline text="The corridor will link Lamu on Kenya's coast to Juba, South Sudan, 1,700 km away, and it aims to combine the development of a new port at Lamu, 2,240 kms of oil pipeline from Lamu to South Sudan and road and railway links to the west of Kenya, then into South Sudan as well as plans for road and rail links to Addis Ababa via Moyale. It also involves plans for the construction of an oil refinery, three international airports at Lamu, Isiolo and Lokichoggio, and three 'resort cities' along the line of the railway at Lamu, Isiolo and Lake Turkana."/>
						<outline text="Any of these elements would have a significant impact on Kenyan development; in combination they could transform the whole region. There are further long-term ideas and as the UN Commission on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) reports, the project is eventually intended ''to transform regional economies through increased trade, integration and interconnectivity spanning South Sudan and Ethiopia with a first-time land bridge across the middle of Africa from Lamu, all the way to Doula, Cameroon, on the coast of the Atlantic Ocean''."/>
						<outline text="LAPSSET was launched on March 2, 2012 by the governments of Kenya, South Sudan and Ethiopia, with Presidents Mwai Kibaki and Salva Kiir and Ethiopia's late Prime Minister Meles Zenawi at a formal ground- breaking ceremony for the new Lamu port. MoU's for the proposed railway and pipeline were signed between the three governments, and the World Bank funded the feasibility study and design of the transport corridor linking Kenya to Southern Sudan. In April 2013, Kenya established the LAPSSET Development Authority (LDA), to manage implementation of the various project components, and appointed Silvester Kasuku, former Infrastructure Secretary, CEO. Uganda has subsequently become associated with the project."/>
						<outline text="Progress has been varied with some aspects on schedule, but construction of Lamu Port, the railway, the oil pipeline and oil refinery all delayed. A Chinese company tender has been accepted for the construction of three berths at the new Lamu Port, crucial for importing construction material for other projects, and these should be completed by 2017. It is planned that the port will eventually have thirty-two berths and will be three times the size of Mombasa, and be deep enough to accommodate post-''Panamax'' vessels."/>
						<outline text="Road links are on schedule. The Lamu '' Isiolo '' Lokichar '' Lodwar '' Nadapal section to the South Sudan border measures1,256 kms; and the link to Ethiopia from Isiolo (470kms) is under construction; Ethiopia is constructing the road on its side of the border. Work has started on the international airport at Isiolo, which has also been identified as a 'resort city'. Isiolo is also intended, under Vision 2030, to become an export processing zone, with livestock and related food processing plants, an oil refinery and will become an international tourist center. Suitable sites have been identified at both Isiolo and Lake Turkana for 'resort centers'. The railway, 1,500 kms standard gauge from Lamu to Isiolo (530kms), Isiolo to Moyale (450kms) and Isiolo to Nakodok (420km), has yet to start."/>
						<outline text="The oil pipeline depends upon decisions of the South Sudan government. It commissioned a $3million feasibility study to study a possible route. This looked at two options, comparing merged pipelines from the oilfields in Unity State and Upper Nile State at Juba or elsewhere and then taking these to either Djibouti or Lamu. The results have not been made public, but reportedly, the study found both technically viable, so now South Sudan has to make a decision on the basis of cost, terrain and other aspects. The route to Djibouti would be 1,600km, and to Lamu 2,100 km. The longer distance requires more pumping for the oil to reach the export terminal and also more oil to fill the pipeline. Economically, the pipeline to Djibouti through Ethiopia would be cheaper, but both Kenya and Uganda now want a pipeline following the discovery of commercial oil deposits around Lake Albert in Uganda and the discovery of oil in Turkana County in north-western Kenya. Shared petroleum infrastructure makes sense for Kenya and Uganda. At their summit in Mombasa in August this year, the Presidents of Kenya, South Sudan and Uganda directed officials to integrate plans for a South Sudan, Lokichar, Hoima pipeline into the LAPSSET Corridor plans by the end of the year. LAPSSET expects a tender for a pipeline to be issued by the end of the year."/>

						<outline text="The issue of a refinery remains open with possible options for Isiolo, Lamu, or in Uganda. No agreement has yet been reached."/>
						<outline text="Another area of uncertainty remains funding. The costs are currently budgeted at up to $30 billion but are expected to rise. The Kenyan government is funding 25 percent, and public-private partnerships are expected to provide the back-bone of this. The government will invest approximately six per cent of its annual Gross Domestic Product during the first five or more years of development, and then three and four per cent of annual GDP. There are reports that China has offered low-cost loans to finance Lamu and speculation that foreign government agencies and international development banks will be prepared to invest in infrastructure as a humanitarian or development project. There has been international interest from Japan as well as China, and other possibilities for investment and funding include South Korea, Qatar, Brazil and South Africa. USAID and the Grow Africa Investment Forum have been active in supporting agriculture and livestock growth along the corridor."/>
						<outline text="Concerns have been raised over potential environmental degradation and destruction of ecosystems, and over the possible impact on local populations. The Kenyan government has made it clear historical sites and fragile ecosystems at Lamu will not be affected by construction. LAPSSET's CEO, Silvester Kasuku, says firmly that environmental issues have been taken into consideration, and notes that government has allocated funds for capacity development, compensation and setting up community steering committees. ''Nothing really meaningful will happen unless people agree; there will be continued engagement with communities and dialogue with local leaders.''"/>
						<outline text="In sum, LAPSSET aims to integrate regional transport infrastructure, covering Kenya, Uganda, South Sudan and Ethiopia, and Kenya's maritime shipping industry. It will relieve Mombasa, one of the most congested ports in Africa. It will provide massive development opportunities for Kenya, employment creation, investment, and economic growth, as well as help to tap resources, introduce high-value investments, new technologies, create stronger domestic labor capacity, reducing unemployment rates and poverty levels. South Sudan and Uganda would also benefit significantly as would Ethiopia. With Ethiopia's rapidly growing economy, LAPSSET offers access to other major port to handle its increasing transportation demands. The corridor would provide access to Ethiopia's planned sugarcane developments in the southwest."/>
						<outline text="LAPSSET is a highly ambitious project requiring considerable foreign investment but it is now attracting substantial interest from multinational companies as oil discoveries are made in the region. The opportunities presented by LAPSSET promise new trade routes with international partners in the Middle East and Asia, greater regional stability arising from a secure export corridor for South Sudan, and the very real potential to lift millions from poverty through jobs and economic infrastructure development."/>

						<outline text="The recent announcement of the $1.35 billion Glencore Xstrata (GLNCY-LON) takeover of Chad oil producer Caracal Energy (CRCL-LON) and the $1.55 billion Al Mirqab Capital takeover of Heritage Oil (HOIL-LON) announced last week are the beginning of a big year for African oils consolidation."/>
						<outline text="GMP Securities analyst Tao Ly commented recently: ''following Glencore's bid for Caracal, we think the significance of this latest bid for Heritage again confirms that valuations in the sector are low enough to attract opportune M&amp;A'...''"/>
						<outline text="In addition to low valuations, the key driver of further consolidation in the African oil space will be access to rift basin assets. These basins have accounted for almost all of the billion-barrel-plus oil discoveries onshore Africa in recent years with the Kenya rift basins currently ranked as the hottest onshore exploration jurisdiction in the world."/>
						<outline text="With significant industry interest, low valuations relative to resource potential, and large rift basin acreage positions, Kenyan rift oil companies Africa Oil Corp. (AOI-TSX;  AOIFF-US) and Taipan Resources (TPN-TSX-V; TAIPF-US) are primed for potential takeovers."/>
						<outline text="The first major rift basin oil acquisition was completed by Tullow Oil (TLW-LON) in 2010 with the $1.45 billion purchase of the Heritage Oil Lake Albert Rift Basin assets in Uganda. Tullow then sold two-thirds of the Lake Albert assets to Chinese National Oil Company CNOOC (CEO-NYSE) and Supermajor Total SA (TOT-NYSE) in 2011 for $2.9 billion. Tullow estimates that there is 1.7 billion barrels of recoverable oil in the Lake Albert Rift Basin and is going to spend billions of dollars developing this asset with its partners."/>
						<outline text="Tullow has also been a leader in the rift basin in Kenya where it farmed-into the Kenyan exploration assets of Africa Oil Corp. prior to the play-opening Ngamia-1 discovery that was made in 2012."/>
						<outline text="Early entrants into the rift basins In Kenya have had huge exploration success and stock market gains. The market cap of Africa Oil Corp. increased from $250 million prior to drilling to $2.5 billion after the Ngamia-1 well.  There have been a number of follow-on discoveries in Kenya and Africa Oil Corp. now has 7 rigs operating in the region with partners Tullow, Marathon Oil (MRO-NYSE), and Afren (AFR-LON) and is drilling six new basin opening wells this year."/>
						<outline text="Over 368 million barrels of oil have been discovered so far in Kenya with expectations for the total amount of resources to be well above a billion barrels of oil. With large scalable concentrated rift basin assets, Africa Oil is firmly in the sweet spot to be acquired by larger oil companies like CNOOC and Total. The question is not if, but when and for how much."/>
						<outline text="It is likely that Africa Oil Corp. has already had a number of approaches from Big Oil and is waiting for the right time to sell. This is likely to be later this year after the company has completed further appraisal wells and well tests to better determine the value of its discovered resources in the Lokichar basin. The company is also drilling a number of potential basin-opening wells this year that it may want to complete prior to a take-out."/>
						<outline text="One of the other reasons Africa Oil is so attractive is that the company has a market cap of only $2.5 billion, making it an easy tuck-in acquisition for Big Oil companies. Most of the other companies operating in Kenya like Marathon Oil and Tullow have market caps of well over $10 billion, while mid-cap companies like Afren have an asset base that is too diversified."/>
						<outline text="Taipan Resources is the fourth largest acreage holder in Kenya and has a two well fully funded drilling program in 2014 targeting over $1 billion of resources net to the company. Sproule International has also independently assessed that on Taipan's operated Block 2B alone, there is mean gross unrisked prospective prospective resources of 1.6 billion barrels based on 19 exploration leads. Taipan has a market cap of only $40 million, making the company the other likely takeover candidate in Kenya in 2014."/>
						<outline text="Big Oil won't be interested in Taipan, they are willing to pay billions of dollars after a discovery is made.  But mid-sized exploration companies can't afford to wait and will take the opportunity to make a cheap acquisition with two high impact oil wells fully carried and funded. With 19 exploration leads Block 2B would also give a larger, cash rich oil company years of drilling inventory in the hottest onshore rift basin exploration region in the world."/>
						<outline text="While the market hasn't yet fully appreciated the potential of Taipan's assets, industry certainly has. Premier Oil (PMO-LON) is spending $30.5 million on one of Taipan's blocks this year to drill the Badada prospect after agreeing to a farm-in deal in 2013, and Afren is spending a similar amount on Taipan's other block to drill the Khorof prospect this year."/>
						<outline text="Paul Logan, who was the Chief Geologist at Heritage Oil that made the original Lake Albert Rift Basin discoveries, also joined Taipan late last year. Logan discovered the 1.7 billion barrels in the Lake Albert Rift Basin, drilling six discovery wells in a row with 100% exploration success."/>
						<outline text="At the recent Premier Oil investor day, Andrew Lodge Exploration Director of Premier also commented on Block 2B:"/>
						<outline text="''the trick to this is to attempt to identify the Tertiary Rift Basins within the Anza Basin which are analogous to Uganda and the Lokichar discoveries. We think we've found that through farming into Taipan's acreage. We took a 55% interest. We have just done some prospective seismic survey, verified the main prospect and will drill that prospect, Badada this year. The ultimate resource potential in the block is over 1 billion barrels but the key to this, the key unlocker will be the Badada well'....&quot;"/>
						<outline text="Taipan is now fully funded for the Badada and Khorof wells this year with an unrisked NPV net to Taipan of $1.34 billion. This equates to over $8 per share on a fully diluted basis. Taipan closed at $0.40 per share yesterday."/>
						<outline text="The risked value of Taipan's two wells this year is $1.50 per share. This means that an acquirer could justify paying up to $1.50 per share pre-drilling."/>
						<outline text="At $0.40 per share Taipan is an attractive risk/reward proposition for mid-sized exploration company. If the market doesn't close the Taipan valuation gap, industry will."/>

						<outline text="For five months, fighting in South Sudan has robbed that country of hope and denied its people the peace and prosperity they deserve.  The agreement South Sudan President Salva Kiir and Riek Machar signed today in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, holds the promise of bringing the crisis to an end.  We deeply appreciate the important role the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) played in facilitating the talks.  We commend IGAD for its persistent pursuit of peace, and its Chairman, Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn, for his leadership.  We urge President Kiir and Mr. Machar to move swiftly to honor the agreement in word and deed by ending the violence and negotiating in good faith to reach a political agreement that can ensure stability, prosperity and peace for all of South Sudan's people."/>

						<outline text="WASHINGTON'--Timothy Geithner says in a new memoir that he considered stepping down as Treasury secretary in 2010 after the financial crisis and suggested Hillary Rodham Clinton as a possible successor."/>
						<outline text="President Barack Obama rebuffed Geithner's suggestion, and he remained at Treasury until 2013."/>
						<outline text="Geithner's memoir will be published next week. On Thursday, The Associated Press bought an early copy."/>
						<outline text="Geithner writes of the incident in ''Stress Test,'' which explores his turbulent four years at Treasury. During his tenure, the Obama administration faced the worst recession and most severe financial crisis since the Great Depression."/>
						<outline text="In proposing that the White House consider Clinton as his successor, Geithner cited her star power as secretary of state. Among the other names Geithner suggested was Jack Lew, who succeeded him last year."/>
						<outline text="No Treasury secretary since the Depression confronted so many financial threats at once. Geithner's supporters said he deserved credit for helping steady the banking system, restore investor confidence and avert a complete meltdown."/>
						<outline text="His critics countered that Geithner's policies consistently favored big banks and neglected ordinary Americans, including many struggling to save their homes after a wave of foreclosures followed the housing bust."/>
						<outline text="When Geithner became Treasury secretary in January 2009, the economy had sunk into a deep recession. Unemployment was surging, and the financial system was teetering."/>
						<outline text="Having previously led the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Geithner had worked with his predecessor at Treasury, Henry Paulson, and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke to craft the government's early response to the financial crisis. The crisis erupted in the fall of 2008 with the fall of investment bank Lehman Brothers and the government takeover of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac."/>

						<outline text="(Phys.org) '--Scientists working together on Kelp Watch 2014 announced today that the West Coast shoreline shows no signs of ocean-borne radiation from Japan's Fukushima nuclear power plant disaster, following their analysis of the first collection of kelp samples along the western U.S. coastline."/>
						<outline text="Kelp Watch 2014 is a project that uses coastal kelp beds as detectors of radioactive seawater arriving from Fukushima via the North Pacific Current. It is a collaborative effort led by Steven Manley, marine biology professor at California State University, Long Beach (CSULB), and Kai Vetter, head of applied nuclear physics at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) and a nuclear engineering professor at the University of California, Berkeley."/>
						<outline text="The new results are from samples primarily collected from Feb. 24 through March 14."/>
						<outline text="During the first phase of the project, samples were taken from 38 of the 44 sites originally identified, and the data being presented comes from an analysis of 28 of the 38 sample sites represented."/>
						<outline text="&quot;Our data does not show the presence of Fukushima radioisotopes in West Coast Giant Kelp or Bull Kelp,&quot; Manley said. &quot;These results should reassure the public that our coastline is safe, and that we are monitoring it for these materials. At the same time, these results provide us with a baseline for which we can compare samples gathered later in the year.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="The samples analyzed to date were gathered from as far north as Kodiak Island, Alaska, to as far south as Baja California. Two sites in the tropics'--Hawaii and Guam, where non-kelp brown algae were sampled (kelps are not found in the tropics)'--were also negative for Fukushima radiation."/>
						<outline text="&quot;The samples of greatest concern were those from the north, Alaska to Washington State, where it is thought the radioactive water will first make contact with North America,&quot; Manley continued. &quot;The tell-tale isotopic signature of Fukushima, Cs-134, was not seen, even at the incredibly low detection limits provided by Dr. Vetter's group at the Berkeley Lab and UC Berkeley.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="Vetter added, &quot;We will also publish results of naturally occurring radiation sources, such as those associated with the decay of uranium and thorium, to help provide context to our findings on radioisotopes Cs-134 and Cs-137 from Fukushima.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="Although initiated as a California-centric endeavor with 30 sites, Kelp Watch 2014 has steadily grown to include many sites along the west coast of North America and beyond. Manley noted that the project also has Giant Kelp from Chile in South America that will serve as a reference site, far removed from any potential influence from Fukushima."/>
						<outline text="Information about the procedures and results, including the results of the first samples' analyses, are available to the public at kelpwatch.berkeley.edu. The researchers will continually update the website for public viewing as more samples arrive and are analyzed, including samples from Canada."/>
						<outline text="&quot;Because the Pacific Northwest may be ground zero for its arrival, we will be receiving monthly samples from the west and southern coastline of Vancouver Island (Canada),&quot; Manley explained. &quot;One of the goals of Kelp Watch 2014 is to keep the public informed, to let them know we are on top of this event, and to document the amount of Fukushima radiation that enters our kelp forest ecosystem.&quot;"/>

						<outline text="The new results are from samples primarily collected from Feb. 24 through March 14."/>
						<outline text="During the first phase of the project, samples were taken from 38 of the 44 sites originally identified, and the data being presented comes from an analysis of 28 of the 38 sample sites represented."/>
						<outline text="&quot;Our data does not show the presence of Fukushima radioisotopes in West Coast Giant Kelp or Bull Kelp,&quot; Manley said. &quot;These results should reassure the public that our coastline is safe, and that we are monitoring it for these materials. At the same time, these results provide us with a baseline for which we can compare samples gathered later in the year.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="The samples analyzed to date were gathered from as far north as Kodiak Island, Alaska, to as far south as Baja California. Two sites in the tropics'--Hawaii and Guam, where non-kelp brown algae were sampled (kelps are not found in the tropics)'--were also negative for Fukushima radiation."/>
						<outline text="&quot;The samples of greatest concern were those from the north, Alaska to Washington State, where it is thought the radioactive water will first make contact with North America,&quot; Manley continued. &quot;The tell-tale isotopic signature of Fukushima, Cs-134, was not seen, even at the incredibly low detection limits provided by Dr. Vetter's group at the Berkeley Lab and UC Berkeley.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="Vetter added, &quot;We will also publish results of naturally occurring radiation sources, such as those associated with the decay of uranium and thorium, to help provide context to our findings on radioisotopes Cs-134 and Cs-137 from Fukushima.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="Although initiated as a California-centric endeavor with 30 sites, Kelp Watch 2014 has steadily grown to include many sites along the west coast of North America and beyond. Manley noted that the project also has Giant Kelp from Chile in South America that will serve as a reference site, far removed from any potential influence from Fukushima."/>
						<outline text="Information about the procedures and results, including the results of the first samples' analyses, are available to the public at kelpwatch.berkeley.edu. The researchers will continually update the website for public viewing as more samples arrive and are analyzed, including samples from Canada."/>
						<outline text="&quot;Because the Pacific Northwest may be ground zero for its arrival, we will be receiving monthly samples from the west and southern coastline of Vancouver Island (Canada),&quot; Manley explained. &quot;One of the goals of Kelp Watch 2014 is to keep the public informed, to let them know we are on top of this event, and to document the amount of Fukushima radiation that enters our kelp forest ecosystem.&quot;"/>

						<outline text="Lloyd's of London, the world's oldest and biggest insurance market, has for the first time called on insurers to incorporate climate change into their models."/>
						<outline text="The call to action comes a day after a landmark US report, named the National Climate Assessment, which has warned that climate change is wreaking havoc across the US."/>
						<outline text="Lloyd's says damage and weather-related losses around the world have increased from an annual average of $50bn in the 1980s to close to $200bn over the last 10 years."/>
						<outline text="The 326-year-old insurance market, whose members write insurance business worldwide, believes the time has come for a formal call on the industry to take into account various climate-change scenarios to avoid unpredictable losses to businesses."/>
						<outline text="What the industry describes as extreme weather events have increased in number and severity as the global climate system has altered, causing more and bigger hurricanes, typhoons and heatwaves around the world. In the UK the main climate-change related risk is flooding."/>
						<outline text="Typhoon Haiyan, which last November swept across south-east Asia, especially affecting the Philippines, was one of the strongest tropical cyclones ever recorded."/>
						<outline text="The year 2011 was the most expensive on record for natural disasters, with insured losses costing the industry more than $126bn."/>
						<outline text="Superstorm Sandy caused $35bn of insured losses two years ago, making it the second costliest hurricane in US history after hurricane Katrina in 2005."/>
						<outline text="A new report by Lloyd's, which consulted the world's largest catastrophe modelling firms, says a 20cm rise in the sea level at the southern tip of Manhattan Island increased Superstorm Sandy's surge losses by 30% (up to $8bn) in New York alone."/>
						<outline text="The 840-page National Climate Assessment, published this week, was described by John Holdren, the White House science adviser, as the &quot;loudest and clearest alarm bell to date signalling the need to take urgent action to combat the threats to Americans from climate change&quot;."/>
						<outline text="Trevor Maynard, head of exposure management and reinsurance at Lloyd's, said: &quot;Climate change is very much here to stay. Hurricanes are getting stronger worldwide, and especially over the north Atlantic '... At the moment we are heading for a rise of four degrees [in temperatures] by the end of the century.&quot; He said that increased threats ranged from property damage to political risk '' such as the implications for food security '' and the economic impacts."/>
						<outline text="It could mean the insurance industry would need to hold more capital to protect against increased risk, he said."/>
						<outline text="Maynard said that while insurers typically arrange insurance cover for a stretch of one year, planners and building constructors would need to look ahead to the next 40 to 50 years."/>
						<outline text="Maynard said: &quot;There is every indication that [storms] will get more extreme as the temperature rises.&quot; He noted that the report by Sir Nicholas Stern on the economics of climate change concluded that it was cheaper &quot;to avoid it&quot;."/>
						<outline text="Lloyd's made a £516m loss in 2011 after paying out the largest catastrophe claims on record '' caused by earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand, storms in the US, and floods in Thailand and Australia. The area flooded in Thailand was the size of Birmingham and it remained under water for a couple of months."/>
						<outline text="Since this year Lloyd's has been run by Inga Beale, who became chief executive of the company in January. The organisation, which started in a coffee house in 1688 where merchants insured ships and has evolved into a group of about 80 competing insurance syndicates, has insured a large range of items, from Keith Richards' fingers to satellites, as well as provided cover for homes and companies."/>

						<outline text="''We are now even more bullish that an El Ni±o is impending,'' Michelle L'Heureux, a meteorologist with the federal Climate Prediction Centre in Maryland confirmed, basing her prediction on the latest data and computer models tracking ocean temperatures in the Pacific."/>
						<outline text="Writing on the realclimate.org website, Ms L'Heureux says that prospects for an El Ni±o reach ''a peak probability of 80 per cent during the late fall/early winter of this year''. That still leaves a two-in-ten possibility that it won't happen, of course. And if it does emerge, the likely strength of it can't yet be gauged."/>
						<outline text="''At this point, the team remains non-committal on the possible strength of El Ni±o preferring to watch the system for at least another month or more before trying to infer the intensity,'' Ms L'Heureux wrote. ''But, could we get a super strong event? The range of possibilities implied by some models allude to such an outcome, but at this point the uncertainty is just too high.''"/>
						<outline text="The last major El Ni±o, which comes with the gathering of unusually warm surface waters in the tropical Pacific that in turn alters the course of the upper atmosphere jet stream, was in 1997. On that occasion, the surface of central and eastern sections of the ocean jumped by 5 degrees Fahrenheit."/>
						<outline text="Usually an El Ni±o is associated with higher global temperatures, though for northern Europe, including Britain, they can spell unusually cold and dry winters. Other regions could expect more far-reaching effects, some potentially beneficial others much less so."/>
						<outline text="Futures markets are already bracing for possible global food shortages amidst fears that a strong El Ni±o could see crops drowned by heavy rains in the American Midwest and Brazil and shrivelled by excessive heat and lack of water in Australia, Southeast Asia, India and Africa."/>
						<outline text="But an El Ni±o generally heralds elevated rain- and snow-fall amounts for the western half the US. That would be welcome news since California and other western states are currently suffering a serious multi-year drought. Equally well received would be the prospect of diminished hurricane activity in the Atlantic. More hurricanes would be likely in the Pacific, however."/>

						<outline text="In an unprecedented speech outlining his vision for Europe, Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi called for courageous leaders to work towards a United States of Europe."/>
						<outline text="&quot;For my children's future I dream, think and work for the United States of Europe,'' Renzi said, speaking at the State of the Union in Florence, launching an appeal to convince European leaders to show &quot;not in the cold language of technocracy, that a stronger and more cohesive Europe is the only solution to the solve the problems of our time.''"/>
						<outline text="In outlining his vision, Renzi also mapped out the priorities for the Italian presidency of the EU, starting on the 1st of July."/>
						<outline text="Beginning with the European elections, which &quot;for the first time&quot; are set not as &quot;a summation of election campaigns, but something broader&quot;, he warned against the specter of anti-European populism. All mainstream political forces should not be scared to talk out loud, and point to the different line-ups that those populist parties have in terms of history and culture, and the way they are united by the desire to destroy what we have built. ''Populism will thrive on abstentionism,'' Renzi said."/>
						<outline text="The only effective response, according to the prime minister, is to offer &quot;an idea of ''Europe that corresponds to an attractive adventure, rather than just a financial or economic exercise,&quot; showing that the EU &quot;is not only a common past but a common destiny, to which it is impossible to escape.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="Renzi has indicated his priorities for the Italian presidency: growth and employment as the founding values ''of Europe, citizenship rights and openness to the world, not only in terms of trade and economic relations, but also in terms of values."/>
						<outline text="''We cannot call ourselves Europeans if, when we witness the pain of the world, we turn the other way,&quot; he said."/>
						<outline text="If it is true that the last period of European integration was dominated by the financial and economic crisis and the need to address these challenges, it is also true that some of the European rules must be changed."/>
						<outline text="And the change that Renzi has in mind is radical: &quot;We need a light Europe, whereby the rules are simple and better shared.''"/>
						<outline text="At the end of his speech, Renzi highlighted immigration as a top priority: &quot;The economy of trade cannot close in fences and cause us to lose sight of the fundamental value of openness in the world, which calls for a redefinition of the concept of the borders, especially those in the Mediterranean."/>
						<outline text="&quot;Is the Mediterranean an Italian or European border?'' asked the prime minister. He said he agrees with the European Commissioner for Home Affairs, Cecilia Malmstroem, for whom asylum rights should be under European law and not just a national competence."/>
						<outline text="''No day in our presidency will pass without us showing the contrast between a Europe that affirms its values, and a Europe that could not practice them, when it denies the possibility to our brothers and sisters to be welcomed in all the EU,&quot; said Renzi."/>

						<outline text="BRUSSELS - Low inflation, weak demand and high unemployment are not the only reasons for a strong euro, which is a &quot;matter of serious concern&quot; for the governing board of the European Central Bank (ECB)."/>
						<outline text="Russia's actions in Ukraine are &quot;certainly one of the reasons&quot;, with credit flows from Russia and Ukraine &quot;having the effect of keeping the euro strong,&quot; ECB chief Mario Draghi said Thursday (8 May) in a press conference."/>
						<outline text="The euro is appreciating because it is seen as a safe haven by investors, compared to the shaky Ukrainian hryvnia and the Russian ruble."/>
						<outline text="Even though the ECB board decided to keep its interest rates unchanged for the moment, Draghi added there is &quot;consensus&quot; among eurozone central bankers that low inflation - 0.7 percent in April - has to be countered with &quot;unconventional tools.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="He also said this decision will be taken in June after the ECB staff comes up with economic projections for the months to come."/>
						<outline text="Back in the times of his predecessor, Jean-Claude Trichet, the standard answer when asked if the ECB will move interest rates was: &quot;We never precommit.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="But Draghi is more blunt. &quot;The era of 'we never precommit' has finished a long time ago,&quot; he quipped."/>
						<outline text="Meanwhile, a special working group within the ECB has been set up to &quot;monitor the geopolitical risk&quot; - codename for the Russia crisis - and its fallout on the eurozone."/>
						<outline text="Draghi warned that an &quot;escalation of sanctions&quot;, along with the recession which has gripped Russia and the instability in Ukraine &quot;would certainly impact the eurozone and the EU more than other parts of the world.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="He said similar working groups are being set up in national central banks, notably in those countries that trade most intensely with Russia and Ukraine."/>
						<outline text="As for media reports that businessmen in Russia are trying to get their capital out and are again flocking to tax havens such as Cyprus - a major issue last year before the island could receive its bailout - Draghi said: &quot;We have no evidence where exactly the capital is going.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="&quot;If they go to Cyprus, it means that there is renewed confidence in the Cypriot economy. The government has been acting in compliance with the programme, capital controls are gradually lifted,&quot; he added."/>
						<outline text="A spokesman for the German finance ministry - one of the key actors demanding drastic measures against Russian depositors in Cyprus - told this website that Russian capital inflows in Cyprus &quot;would not raise any concerns for the moment&quot;."/>
						<outline text="Looking ahead, with EU elections dominated by eurosceptic debates in several countries, Draghi said in his opinion, the euro crisis was caused partly by &quot;too little integration&quot;."/>
						<outline text="&quot;Our future lies with more integration, not with the renationalisation of our economies,&quot; he said."/>

						<outline text="A bondholder holds a sign as he takes part in a protest outside the central Bank of Greece in October 2012 (Photo: Reuters) A Thessaloniki man who was one of the estimated 15,000 small Greek bondholders that suffered losses under the country's debt restructuring in 2012 took his own life on Tuesday evening, the day before his 57th birthday."/>
						<outline text="The so-called haircut, which wiped out the life savings of many, left the man in a dire financial situation, according to his widow. "/>
						<outline text="On Thursday, an association representing small bondholders said that the man's death has brought to 17 the number of small bondholders who have taken their lives since the haircut. "/>
						<outline text="His wife discovered his body on Wednesday hanging from a tree in a small woods near a the village of Sozopoli, outside Thessaloniki, where they maintained a family home. He had travelled to the village the day before."/>
						<outline text="&quot;He had indicated several times that he wanted to put an end to his life. I didn't believe that my husband could do this ... He said it, he mimicked it, but I never thought he would do it,&quot; his wife, Antigoni Karasavva, told the thestival.gr news site."/>
						<outline text="She said he was a &quot;victim of the country's economic crisis&quot;, someone &quot;who believed the Greek state, invested his money in the Greek state, believing it was more secure than the banks&quot;. The March 2012 haircut plunged him into a deep depression, she added."/>
						<outline text="Laying the blame for her husband's death squarely the government, who she accused of robbing the country, Karasavva said: &quot;I might also get my turn on that tree. But right now I have become a mother and a father and have become strong so that I can support my child.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="As a result of the March 2012 haircut, Greece reduced its public debt by about '¬100bn. Private creditors swapped government bonds for new ones, incurring a 53.5% nominal writedown, with the remaining value being paid out with maturities of up to 30 years, by which time most of the bondholders, many of them pensioners, will have died. "/>
						<outline text="Small investors were estimated to own bonds worth '¬2.3bn in total, with most worth holding between '¬5,000 and '¬150,000 worth. In real terms, the small bondholders say they have lost more than 75% of their investment. "/>

						<outline text="Around midnight on February 13, a young Nigerian man named Femi* was jolted out of his evening prayer by shouting outside his window. A crowd of some 40 people had gathered around his house. &quot;No more homosexuals in Gishiri!&quot; they yelled, referring to Femi's neighborhood within Nigeria's capital city, Abuja. The mob broke down his door and dragged him outside in his boxers. They beat him and about 13 other gay men that night with broken furniture, machete handles, sticks, and a garden rake, vowing to kill them if they didn't clear out of the neighborhood. "/>
						<outline text="The attack, andother acts of vigilante violence targeting gays and lesbians around the country, was motivated by a new anti-gay law that Nigeria's president signed January 7. The measure, modeled off the one that Uganda enacted in late February, levies harsh prison sentences on anyone who makes a &quot;public show&quot; of a &quot;direct&quot; or &quot;indirect&quot; same-sex relationship or supports an LGBT organization (10 years), and anyone who attempts to enter into a same-sex marriage (14 years), even though this would be virtually impossible in Nigeria. The anti-gay backlash the law has provoked in Nigeria has led not just to violence, but to homelessness, unemployment, harassment, and a steep drop-off in HIV/AIDS treatment. "/>
						<outline text="John Adeniyi narrowly escaped the attack in Gishiri and has been recording accounts of the violence that night. He's a human rights program officer atthe International Center for Advocacy on Rights to Health (ICARH), an HIV intervention organization based in Abuja. To find out what life is like for Nigeria's gay community under the country's new law'--and what gay Ugandans are starting to face'--I visited withAdeniyi during a recent trip to Nigeria. "/>
						<outline text="&quot;All the [Gishiri] victims are presently homeless,&quot; Adeniyi told me, explaining that Femi and the other victims are afraid to return to their homes, lest their neighbors make good on their pledge to kill them. &quot;Including me. I cannot go back to Gishiri village.&quot; After the attack, members of the mob spray-painted homophobic slogans on the homes of residents suspected of being gay."/>
						<outline text="Four of the residents who were attacked that night subsequently lost their jobs after their employers discovered their sexuality, according to several victims. Chukwuemeka*, a 22-year-old living with HIV, used to work as a cashier. He was fired after the February mob attack, and he now spends his nights in a roadside auto repair shack. Femi owns a clothing boutique, but now he is afraid to go back. &quot;Next week the bank will start calling me,&quot; he says, referring to an overdue payment he owes on a 100,000 Naira (about $600) loan he took out to start his business."/>
						<outline text="As in most African countries, homosexuality has been illegal in Nigeria since the British colonial era, but convictions were rare. Nigerians used to be generally tolerant of LGBT people in their midst, even if they were homophobic, Adeniyi says, but the new law'--imposing harsh penalties for homosexuality'--has stirred up a wave of anti-gay sentiment in the deeply religious country. &quot;People already knew that people were gay,&quot; he says. &quot;Now, what we have seen is tenants threatening other tenants, saying, 'I'm going to expose you. I know what you do.''...Now they can call the police and get people convicted.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="And since the law does not define who is gay and who is not, the police and the general public are making the determination themselves, sparking witch hunts around the country. Adeniyi says that the head of the police department where Gishiri victims were held overnight after the attack, told them he knew they were gay, citing several arbitrary characteristics: &quot;He said, 'You, because you wrote down you're a hairdresser, you must be gay'...The two of you, because you guys live together, you have to be gay.' He talked to one other, and said, 'I'm sure you picked up a gay personality because you schooled abroad.'&quot;"/>
						<outline text="&quot;After they passed the bill into law'--wow. It's hell in Nigeria. Nobody wants to see you. When you walk, they say, 'Why are you walking like this? Are you a gay?'&quot;"/>
						<outline text="In addition to discrimination and harassment, Nigeria's new law has already led to a sharp decline in HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention in a country that has the second highest HIV rate in the world. About 3.4 million Nigerians are infected and some 17 percent of the gay population has the disease. The anti-gay law discourages people from seeking treatment for fear that doing so could out them as gay, and it also criminalizes organizations that serve the LGBT community."/>
						<outline text="Adeniyi estimates that since the law took effect in January, the number of patients coming into ICARH for HIV treatment has dropped by over 50 percent. &quot;One person told me he would rather die'...than come to the organization&quot; and risk imprisonment, he says. He adds that LGBT couples living with HIV may also be discouraged from going to the doctor for couples counseling, out of fear that the doctor may turn them over to the police."/>
						<outline text="Eight organizations that provide HIV treatment and prevention services in northern Nigeria have cut back on HIV outreach, training, and education programs, according to Dorothy Aken'Ova, executive director of Nigeria's International Center for Reproductive Health and Sexual Rights (INCRESE). &quot;People thought, 'You know what? I don't want to be in prison because I'm providing treatment for these gay homosexual people,'&quot; Adeniyi says. He expects more organizations will drop their programs in the coming months."/>
						<outline text="ICARH has had to scale back, too. The group has halted outreach events designed to encourage people to get tested due to concerns that the authorities might interpret this as an effort to aid the gay community. &quot;Since the law has been passed, we are doing counseling and testing, but we have suspended outreaches.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="UNAIDS, a United Nations program to combat HIV/AIDS, and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malariahave warned the new law could hinder progressin the fight against HIV/AIDS in Nigeria. In late January, the US Ambassador to Nigeriasaid the law might impede US efforts to help Nigeriafight the epidemic. Even social scientists have been scared off from taking stock of HIV trends in Nigeria'--data that can improve the response to the epidemic'--until the government can assure researchers that they will be exempt from punishment under the law, says Aken'Ova of INCRESE."/>
						<outline text="The anti-gay crackdown in Nigeria and Uganda is part of a broader trend in Africa, where at least seven other African countrieshave recently moved to tighten their anti-homosexuality laws. In many cases, lawmakers in these countries have been spurred to action by American anti-gay activists and the Christian right, who in some cases stoked fears of homosexuals preying on African children. US evangelicals have had a hand in anti-gay legislation and constitutional reform measures in Nigeria, Uganda, Namibia, Malawi, Kenya, Liberia, Zambia, Rwanda, and Zimbabwe."/>
						<outline text="Thanks to their efforts, life for more and more gay Africans is beginning to look like Chukwuemeka's. &quot;After they passed the bill into law'--wow. It's hell in Nigeria,&quot; he says. &quot;Nobody wants to see you. When you walk, they say, 'Why are you walking like this? Are you a gay?'&quot;"/>

						<outline text="T-shirts with the slogan &quot;Sea Level is for Sissies&quot; (Bolder Boulder)"/>
						<outline text="Out Boulder, an LGBTQ advocacy group, has launched an online petition seeking to pressure organizers of the Bolder Boulder to drop their slogan &quot;Sea Level is for Sissies&quot; because they say the word &quot;sissies&quot; is derogatory."/>
						<outline text="But race organizers say they have no plans to retire the slogan."/>
						<outline text="The Change.org petition was posted Wednesday by Out Boulder's executive director, Mardi Moore, and by the evening it had 25 signatures."/>
						<outline text="&quot;The word is used to (demean) traits that are problematically and stereotypically associated with women,&quot; the petition reads. &quot;Traits that all genders have but are not valued because they are associated with women. ... All genders express emotions and they should be embraced when they do."/>
						<outline text="&quot;It's past due that the Bolder Boulder retire this slogan. Make your voice heard.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="Moore said the slogan is &quot;harmful&quot; and leads to further misunderstanding about gender."/>
						<outline text="&quot;This has been a longstanding issue for us in the LGBT community,&quot; Moore said. &quot;When somebody calls you a sissy, it is not positive. ... That word continues the incorrect thinking that having emotions or expressing something in a stereotypically female way is somehow wrong in society.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="Moore said she was motivated to put up the petition after a letter to the editor by Debbie Ramirez appeared in the Daily Camera on April 21 calling the T-shirt &quot;highly offensive.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="&quot;I am a women who runs, rock climbs and performs well athletically. I also have the traits associated with someone who is called a sissy,&quot; Ramirez wrote. &quot;I cry, I get hurt and I express my emotions. If this is what a sissy is, I am proud to be a sissy and would never wear a T-shirt that does not value these traits in all genders.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="But Bolder Boulder race director Cliff Bosley said organizers of the Memorial Day 10K had a meeting about three years ago with Cathy Busha, then-director of Out Boulder, about the slogan and said he thought they came to an understanding that the slogan was not intended to put anyone down."/>
						<outline text="&quot;While it was not their preference we continue to use it, they understood that it wasn't singling out their organization,&quot; Bosley said."/>
						<outline text="Bosley said Bolder Boulder will not retire the slogan."/>
						<outline text="He added that &quot;Sea Level is for Sissies&quot; has been one of the race's slogans for more than six years, and, along with others like &quot;Altitude Adjustment&quot; and &quot;Run with Altitude,&quot; references the elevation of the annual race."/>
						<outline text="&quot;This is in keeping with that spirit,&quot; Bosley said."/>
						<outline text="He said the T-shirt with the slogan has been one of Bolder Boulder's most popular sale items, and after the letter to the editor appeared in the Camera, he received numerous calls urging him not to do away with it."/>
						<outline text="Moore said she understands the slogan might be popular, but there are better ways to promote the race."/>
						<outline text="&quot;It's a great race, and we're glad it's successful, but there have to be other ways to promote it,&quot; Moore said."/>

						<outline text="HOMS, Syria (AP) -- Thousands of Syrians returned to war-battered parts of the central city of Homs Saturday, many making plans to move back as opposition activists expressed bitterness over the rebels' surrender of their strongholds to pro-government forces and vowed they will return.The homecoming came as rival jihadi factions fought deadly battles to the east in an oil-rich region bordering Iraq, the latest clashes between groups trying to overthrow the central government in Damascus.Residents from Homs' smashed ancient quarters scavenged what they could from their homes, mostly clothes, dusty mattresses and some burned gas canisters, carrying them away in plastic bags and trolleys.&quot;My house was completely destroyed and burnt, but I found some photos,&quot; said Sarmad Mousa, 49, a resident of the old Hamidiyeh district. &quot;They will remain a memory for me of the beautiful days we had here.&quot;Some accused rebels of looting and burning their homes. Smaller crowds made the journey Friday.Other residents were already making plans to stay in their homes, sweeping them clear of rubble and broken glass.&quot;God willing, we will sleep in our homes tonight, not tomorrow,&quot; one man told Lebanese television station al-Mayadeen. &quot;Even if the homes aren't ready, we are going to help each other build our homes,&quot; he said.Hundreds of rebels surrendered their stronghold in Homs to government forces in exchange for their safe passage to the nearby northern countryside as part of a deal that began Wednesday.Some 2,000 rebels - and civilians living there - were badly weakened by the nearly two-year blockade and heavy bombing of the area.The surrender deal is widely seen as a victory for President Bashar Assad weeks ahead of a presidential election on June 3 that he is expected to win, giving him a mandate to continue his violent crackdown on rebels in the Syrian civil war, which activists say has killed more than 150,000 people.Assad has two unknown competitors for the presidential elections, Maher al-Hajjar and Hassan al-Nouri, according to an announcement by Syria's supreme constitutional court on Saturday.The spokesman, Majed Khadra, made the announcement in a broadcast on state-run television.Over 20 candidates had applied to run, but Khadra said they did not obtain the necessary support - approval of their candidacy by at least one-third of Syrian lawmakers. His announcement came after six of the original presidential hopefuls appealed to the constitutional court to accept their candidacies.In the east, al-Qaida breakaway group the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant captured the western sector of the oil-rich province of Deir el-Zour after days of fighting with the al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and a journalist in eastern Syria.The Observatory said the 10-day fighting left at least 230 people dead and displaced more than 100,000.Malba Ali, a Syrian journalist in the province of Hassakeh bordering Deir el-Zour confirmed the Islamic State advances, adding that &quot;many are fleeing the region.&quot; Ali is in contact with activists and residents in Deir el-Zour.For rebels, the withdrawal from Homs was a bitter day, said an opposition activist who uses the name Thaer Khalidiya.&quot;The fighters left to rest and get treatment, but they want to return to liberate Homs,&quot; he said over Skype. &quot;They want to go back.&quot;Municipal workers began fixing power lines in the city while bulldozers cleared rubble from the street. The Syrian Red Crescent gave clean water, food and candles to residents who wanted to return to their homes, Gov. Talal Barazi said.But danger still lurked in some areas. A man, woman and child have been killed in three separate explosions in Homs after detonating rebel-planted mines left in their homes, Barazi said.At least five military vehicles carrying soldiers searched the area for more explosives.Some citizens rushed to the area of Bustan al-Diwan, gathering to pray around the grave of an elderly, beloved Dutch priest who was shot to death in April in a rebel-held part of Homs.Father Francis Van Der Lugt, 75, was a Jesuit, the same order as Pope Francis. His death underscored fears among many of Syria's Christian and Muslim minorities for the fate of their communities as Islamic extremists gain influence among rebels seeking to topple Assad.In the contested northern city of Aleppo, Syria's largest and former commercial center, opposition fighters continued to cut water supplies from government-held neighborhoods for the seventh consecutive day, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights activist group and state news agency SANA said.---Hadid reported from Beirut. Associated Press writer Bassem Mroue contributed to the report from Beirut."/>

						<outline text="NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden told lawyers he met during his sojourn in Hong Kong to put their cell phones in his fridge to thwart any eavesdroppers."/>
						<outline text="But new research suggests he should have been worried about nearby TVs, too."/>
						<outline text="Smart tellies with built-in microphones and storage can be turned into bugging devices by malware and used to record conversations, security experts at NCC Group said. And they demonstrated exactly that just down the road from the Infosec Europe conference, held in London."/>
						<outline text="&quot;Installing the bugging software requires physical access to the device, which is how we did it, or by installing a malicious app,&quot; said Felix Ingram, principal consultant at NCC Group."/>
						<outline text="&quot;Malicious apps could be downloaded from the manufacturer's app store. The TV does have the option for auto-updating, so releasing a legitimate app, then releasing a malicious update, is another attack vector.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="In other words, Ingram's research shows smart TVs can be abused in much the same way that dodgy apps on Android software stores hijack smartphones and tablets."/>
						<outline text="In the NCC demo, the internal storage of a smart TV was used to hold 30 seconds of audio, but a far longer buffer could be set up. The main limitation of the attack is getting malicious code onto vulnerable devices in the first place, as Ingram noted."/>
						<outline text="&quot;The devices contain microphones and cameras that can be utilised by applications, Skype and similar apps being good examples,&quot; Ingram told El Reg."/>
						<outline text="&quot;The TV has a fairly large amount of storage, so would be able to hold more than 30 seconds of audio '' we only captured short snippets for demonstrations purposes. A more sophisticated attack could store more audio locally and only upload it at certain times, or could even stream it directly to a server, bypassing the need to use any of the device's storage."/>
						<outline text="TV builders have released source code that makes developing malware a little easier&quot;There is nothing specific about them running Linux that makes the hacking any easier, though some manufacturers have released some of their source code, which could make developing applications for the devices a little easier.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="The smart TV hacking was part of a demonstration by NCC experts to highlight security shortcomings on the home front of the Internet of Things. Broadband routers and Wi-Fi-controlled power plugs were also attacked, and a smartphone with NFC wireless radio was used in an attempt to clone a hotel room access card."/>
						<outline text="Whatever cryptography was used by the hotel system, it was able to thwart the cloning software, thankfully."/>
						<outline text="The Wi-Fi plugs came with a default password, but without clear instructions on how to change this: users have to download and run an executable to do this, but the software presents an alarming warning that any cock-ups will brick the device."/>
						<outline text="&quot;To update or change the firmware is too complicated,&quot; noted Paul Vlissidis, technical director of NCC Group, in something of an understatement."/>
						<outline text="Software vulnerabilities and weak configurations made it easy for NCC staffers to break into home routers. Folks using compromised broadband gateways could be directed to servers under the control of crims, allowing the crooks to intercept sensitive e-banking or webmail usernames and passwords, for instance."/>
						<outline text="As for internet-connected coffee makers and such gear, compromising that kit provides a stepping stone into a home network for a criminal. Seemingly innocuous devices can be chained together to attack the home of the future, we were told."/>
						<outline text="Net-connected devices are designed with price and functionality in mind rather than security, it seems. &quot;Interoperability trumps security every time,&quot; Vlissidis concluded. ®"/>

						<outline text="Directive from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) makes mention of news reporting referencing unauthorized informatin, like that leaked by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, a punishable offense. (Image credit: Laura Poitras)In a new policy directive from the Obama administrative, national security and other government officials will no longer be allowed to publicly discuss or even reference news reporting that is based on &quot;unauthorized leaks.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="President Obama once promised the American people that his administration would be the most transparent in history, but after years of fights with civil libertarians trying to obtain legal memos used to justify the president's overseas assassination program, an unprecedented pattern of prosecuting government whistleblowers, the targeting of journalists, and all the secrecy and obfuscation related to the NSA's mass surviellance programs made public by Edward Snowden, that claim is now met with near universal laughter, if not scorn, by critics."/>
						<outline text="According to the New York Times:"/>
						<outline text="A new pre-publication review policy for the Office of Director of National Intelligence says the agency's current and former employees and contractors may not cite news reports based on leaks in their speeches, opinion articles, books, term papers or other unofficial writings."/>
						<outline text="Such officials ''must not use sourcing that comes from known leaks, or unauthorized disclosures of sensitive information,'' it says. ''The use of such information in a publication can confirm the validity of an unauthorized disclosure and cause further harm to national security.''"/>
						<outline text="Failure to comply ''may result in the imposition of civil and administrative penalties, and may result in the loss of security clearances and accesses,'' it says."/>
						<outline text="Timothy H. Edgar, a visiting professor at Brown University, told the Times the ODNI directive is overly restrictive because it goes beyond telling officials they cannot comment on or confirm the accuracy of unauthorized leaks'--something he thinks makes sense and is already covered by statute'--but it bizarrely asserts that these people cannot even acknowledge the existence of a story that may have appeared on the cover of a major newspaper."/>
						<outline text="''You're basically saying people can't talk about what everyone in the country is talking about,'' Edgar said. ''I think that is awkward and overly broad in terms of restricting speech.''"/>
						<outline text="The new rule was first reported by journalist Steve Aftergood at the Secrecy News website on Thursday and relates to other rules that guide national security officials who are speak to the press or in public forums."/>
						<outline text="Referencing the Times reporting on the directive, the president's critics were focused on the continued hypocrisy between claims of transparency by the president and other high-level officials and the reality represented by the continued attempt to by the White House and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper to control information:"/>

						<outline text="1 of 2. U.S. President Barack Obama is introduced to speak by Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer at a DNC fund raiser in San Jose, California May 8, 2014."/>
						<outline text="Credit: Reuters/Kevin Lamarque"/>
						<outline text="SAN JOSE, California (Reuters) - President Barack Obama warned tech leaders on Thursday to dig deep in their wallets to fund Democratic candidates and feel a sense of urgency about congressional elections in November or risk further gridlock in Washington and a failure to move on their priorities."/>
						<outline text="Obama was the headline speaker at four California fund-raising events, raising his two-day total to five. His last was a Silicon Valley event in San Jose co-hosted by Y Combinator President Sam Altman and Yahoo Inc CEO Marissa Mayer. About 250 people paid between $1,000 and $32,400 to attend."/>
						<outline text="During his remarks, Obama struck at the heart of the issue that Republicans are using against Democrats in their campaigns: The Affordable Care Act, the Obamacare law whose troubled rollout has given Obama's political opponents much grist for criticism."/>
						<outline text="Republicans have mounted a strong effort to seize control of the Senate from Democrats and are also trying to build on their majority in the House of Representatives. Obama said the effort must be stopped in order to prevent more gridlock in Washington."/>
						<outline text="&quot;The reason that we've got gridlock right now is because you've got a party that's been captured by folks who are on the wrong side of the issues,&quot; he said."/>
						<outline text="Obama, whose own job approval rating under 50 percent is weighing down Democratic prospects in November, said Republicans offer nothing more than their vow to repeal the healthcare law."/>
						<outline text="&quot;If that's all they've got, then they shouldn't be running either chamber, They shouldn't be running the House. And they sure shouldn't be running the Senate,&quot; he said."/>
						<outline text="Earlier Obama took his California fund-raising tour first to the seaside home in La Jolla of Qualcomm founder Iwin Jacobs."/>
						<outline text="The tech industry has raised questions about the scale of the National Security Agency's surveillance under the Obama administration, but there's little sign that Obama is losing support in Silicon Valley."/>
						<outline text="Obama made no mention of these concerns in his luncheon speech attended by 65 guests who paid up to $32,400 per couple for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee."/>
						<outline text="Obama told them that majorities of Americans support the direction that Democrats want to take the country, such as on raising the minimum wage and making sure women receive equal pay as men, but that they have &quot;lost faith that we can actually make it happen&quot; because of Washington gridlock."/>
						<outline text="Obama needs Democrats to do well in November to allow him to advance his agenda in his last two years in office, in 2015 and 2016."/>
						<outline text="But most political analysts believe Republicans will build on their House majority and stand a decent chance of winning the Senate."/>
						<outline text="Obama has been using fund-raising speeches to warn of this outcome, saying Democrats need to avoid getting distracted by media attention on the 2016 presidential election to choose a successor to him."/>
						<outline text="Obama said in La Jolla that Democrats need to gain seats &quot;in order for us to not simply play defense but to actually go back on the offensive for the American people.&quot;"/>

						<outline text="UK internet service providers and the entertainment industry are near to agreeing a deal to combat piracy."/>
						<outline text="After four years of negotiations, BT, Sky, TalkTalk and Virgin Media have said they will send &quot;educational&quot; letters to people who illegally download copyrighted music, television or films."/>
						<outline text="Under the voluntary copyright alert programme (Vcap), the music and movie industry bodies will monitor file-sharing networks for copyright infringements, recording the IP addresses of downloaders."/>
						<outline text="The IP addresses, which identify individual broadband connections, will be given to UK ISPs who in turn will send out a warning letter about the alleged infringement to the registered subscriber of that broadband connection. The first letters will be sent out in 2015."/>
						<outline text="The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) is understood to be looking at the deal, but told the Guardian it did not rubber-stamp agreements."/>
						<outline text="BT, Sky and Virgin Media said they were in talks with the BPI, which represents the British music industry, and the Motion Picture Association (MPA) over Vcap, but that an agreement had not yet been made."/>
						<outline text="The media industry originally intended for Vcap to target alleged repeat copyright infringers with letters informing them of possible punitive measures. Access to a database of known infringers was also requested, which could have led to legal action against internet subscribers."/>
						<outline text="Instead, the draft agreement, seen by the BBC, suggests that no more than 2.5m letters will be sent out each year and that they will have an &quot;educational&quot; tone."/>
						<outline text="Those who download illegal material can expect to receive up to four alerts. The cost of the system will be shared between the rights holders, who will contribute £750,000 or 75% of the cost for each ISP, with a further £75,000 or 75% of the costs a year to cover the running of the service."/>
						<outline text="Vcap was proposed as an alternative to the 2010 Digital Economy Act, which envisioned repeat copyright infringers having their internet connections terminated."/>

						<outline text="A bill introduced at Russia's parliament would seek to protect children from information that &quot;denies or distorts patriotism,&quot; according to the document published on the legislature's website."/>
						<outline text="Submitted Thursday by United Russia lawmaker Arkady Ponomaryov, the bill proposes amendments to Russia's law on protecting children from information deemed detrimental to their well-being, adding supposedly unpatriotic information to the list of knowledge from which Russia's children should be safeguarded."/>
						<outline text="The bill defines &quot;patriotism&quot; as the &quot;love for the fatherland, devotion to it, striving to serve its interests through one's actions.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="If adopted, the bill would add information that &quot;denies or distorts patriotism&quot; to its top category of things from which all children need to be protected, regardless of age. Other items in that category include inducement to commit suicide, promotion of illegal drug use, violence and homosexual relationships."/>
						<outline text="Readers of the Ekho Moskvy website '-- a respected news outlet whose coverage was denounced as &quot;anti-Russian&quot; by pro-Kremlin monitors earlier this year '-- responded with a flurry of comments deriding the bill."/>
						<outline text="&quot;The bill says explicitly that citizens must ensure the interests of the state '-- cogs in a machine, now they don't even have the right to make a yelp against it,&quot; one of the readers commented."/>
						<outline text="Another asked: &quot;What kind of a normal country needs to protect patriotism... by law?&quot;"/>
						<outline text="An explanatory note to the bill cited surveys by the state-funded pollster VTsIOM indicating that the number of Russians who consider themselves &quot;patriots&quot; dropped to 80 percent in December, 2012."/>
						<outline text="No survey data were available to show how Russians' sense of patriotism was affected by the annexation of Crimea, but recent polls showed a significant increase in the number of Russians who consider their country a great power, and President Vladimir Putin's approval ratings soared to a whopping 82 percent in mid-April, according to the Levada Center pollster."/>
						<outline text="All the polls were conducted among 1600 people throughout Russia and carried a 3.4 percent margins of error."/>
						<outline text="&quot;The forming of patriotism begins in early childhood,&quot; Ponomaryov said in his explanatory note to his bill, noting that the view had been upheld by thinkers such as Alexander Herzen '-- a 19th century writer often regarded as the father of Russian socialism."/>
						<outline text="It remained unclear how the bill would deal with classical Russian writers whose views on patriotism did not always toe their government's line."/>
						<outline text="Another Ekho Moskvy reader quoted a poem by Mikhail Lermontov, the great 19th century Russian poet, titled &quot;Motherland,&quot; which was part of mandatory school reading during Soviet times: &quot;I love my homeland, but in the strangest way.&quot;"/>

						<outline text="Russia is planning to put a manned colony on the Moon as soon as in 2030, and is racing to dispatch the first robotic rovers to explore the lunar surface two years from now, a media report says."/>
						<outline text="Newspaper Izvestia said Thursday it had gained access to a draft government program, prepared by the Russian Academy of Sciences, the Roscosmos federal space agency, Moscow State University and several space research institutes, outlining a three-step plan toward manning the moon."/>
						<outline text="A robotic craft would be sent to the Moon as early as in 2016 and through the following decade, and by 2028, Russia would be ready to send manned missions to orbit the Earth's satellite, Izvestia said, citing the report."/>
						<outline text="In the final stage, planned for 2030, humans would be sent to the lunar surface to set up the infrastructure for an initial colony using local resources, the report said. The program also envisages building a space- and Earth-monitoring observatory on the Moon."/>
						<outline text="The Russian document underlined the need for speedy lunar exploration, saying &quot;leading space powers will expand and establish their rights to convenient lunar footholds to ensure future opportunities for practical use,&quot; in the next 20 to 30 years, Izvestia cited the document as saying."/>
						<outline text="The price tag of the mission is uncertain, but the first stage of the program is expected to cost around 28.5 billion rubles ($815.8 million), while earlier estimates indicated that developing and building a piloted spaceship would add 160 billion rubles or so, though Russia hopes to attract private investors to help bankroll the project, the report said."/>
						<outline text="But while the program envisages international cooperation on the project, it stresses that the &quot;independence of the national lunar program must be ensured regardless of the conditions and the extent of the participation in it by foreign partners.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="Lunar resources may present a &quot;treasure-trove&quot; of rare and valuable minerals of substantial strategic importance, according to NASA, but the concentration and the distribution of those elements remain uncertain."/>
						<outline text="The Moon can also be used as a launchpad for future missions into deep space, said the research chief of the Institute of Space Policy, Ivan Moiseyev, Izvestia reported."/>

						<outline text=""/>
						<outline text="SEATTLE (AP) - A federal lawsuit is challenging Washington state's authority to tax marijuana as long as marijuana remains illegal under federal law.The case arises from the state's attempt to collect sales taxes from a medical marijuana dispensary. But lawyer Douglas Hiatt, who filed it late Thursday, said it could throw a wrench in Washington's plans for collecting taxes on recreational marijuana, too."/>
						<outline text="The author of Washington's recreational pot law, Alison Holcomb, disagreed. She doesn't expect the lawsuit to get very far."/>
						<outline text="Hiatt is representing the dispensary's operator, Martin Nickerson, who is simultaneously being prosecuted criminally for marijuana distribution and targeted by the state Department of Revenue for not collecting and remitting taxes on the pot he was allegedly distributing. Nickerson can't pay the tax without incriminating himself in the criminal case, in violation of his constitutional rights, Hiatt argued."/>
						<outline text="Furthermore, the state, which says Nickerson owes more than $62,000, has seized more than $800 from his bank account. Hiatt said it's important to get an answer from a federal court about whether the state took that money legally."/>
						<outline text="Hiatt opposed Washington's recreational marijuana law and argues any meaningful drug law reform must come at the federal level. Nevertheless, he said he doesn't want to &quot;look like the guy spoiling the party.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="&quot;I have no choice,&quot; Hiatt said. &quot;I've got a client, he's got a problem, and we've got to fix it. It's a way to get some clarity on what's allowed.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="The lawsuit asks the U.S. District Court in Seattle whether Washington's decision to tax marijuana sales is in conflict with marijuana's prohibition under federal law. If it is, the court could bar the state from collecting such taxes."/>
						<outline text="But Holcomb said there's little danger of that. The state isn't specifically taxing the marijuana at issue in Nickerson's case - it's applying a general sales tax to marijuana-related transactions, she argued."/>
						<outline text="That's an important difference, she said: If the state had imposed a specific tax on medical marijuana, then Nickerson might be implicating himself by paying it."/>
						<outline text="Instead, when collecting sales taxes on marijuana transactions and turning that money over to the Revenue Department, dispensaries don't have to identity for revenue officials what they sold - they just have to turn over the money owed on the value of the transactions they conducted, Holcomb said. For that reason, Nickerson wouldn't have been implicating himself by turning over the taxes."/>
						<outline text="And if Nickerson was so concerned about it, she suggested, he could have filed a letter along with his taxes insisting that his payment was not an admission of any illegal activity."/>
						<outline text="&quot;The bottom line is he should have been paying his sales taxes along the way,&quot; she said."/>
						<outline text="Hiatt dismissed that analysis. He said that the Revenue Department has sent letters to Nickerson saying that he was selling marijuana and that he owed taxes on the pot he sold."/>
						<outline text="&quot;They're assessing him based on the amount of marijuana they think he has sold,&quot; Hiatt said. &quot;They're not applying a general sales tax to a business; they're saying, 'We're applying this tax to you because you're selling marijuana.' We're not talking about squirt guns.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="The lawsuit also challenges a change made to the state's medical marijuana law in 2011, which expressly allowed cities and counties to adopt zoning requirements, business license requirements and to collect business taxes from marijuana-related operations. It argues that allows the jurisdictions to regulate a substance that's illegal under federal law, in conflict with the Controlled Substances Act."/>
						<outline text="The Revenue Department, which says Nickerson owes more than $62,000, has repeatedly warned medical marijuana dispensaries that they're required to pay regular sales and business taxes. Neither the department nor the state Attorney General's Office immediately responded to inquiries seeking comment on the lawsuit."/>

						<outline text="Since Kim Jong-un succeeded his father, Kim Jong-il, in 2011, the 31-year-old has been trying to make his mark as Supreme Leader of North Korea.However, a recent interview with a North Korean defector from Kim Jong-il's inner circle indicates that Kim Jong-un is nothing more than a symbolic head, and that the real power belongs to a mysterious organization called the Organization and Guidance Department (OGD)."/>
						<outline text="Even weirder?"/>
						<outline text="Its director was none other than Jang Sung-taek, the uncle whom Kim Jong-un executed in December. The execution has, apparently, cut all familial ties between the organization and the country's supreme leader."/>
						<outline text="In the interview, North Korean defector Jang Jin-sung explains that the OGD is like ''an old boys' network'' made up of Kim Jong-il's university friends."/>
						<outline text="Kim Jong-il rose up the ranks with the men who run the organization, and these very men, most of which the world has never seen, are still running the show. "/>
						<outline text="''When Kim Jung-il died and Kim Jong-un succeeded him, people saw the transfer of power from father to son,'' Jang Jin-sung told CNN. ''What they did not see also was what happened to the apparatus of the totalitarian system that supported the rule of Kim Jung-il.''"/>
						<outline text="That apparatus is essentially the OGD, a body of the government that Kim Jong-un may not have close ties with the way his father did. And now that his uncle is out of the picture, there is nothing that ties him to the institution. Jang Jin-sung assesses that the current situation means that Kim Jong-un has no real power as Supreme Leader of North Korea. "/>
						<outline text="''Kim Jung Il had the OGD as his old boys' network,'' Jang said. ''Kim Jong-un may have friends in his Swiss school, but he has no one inside North Korea."/>
						<outline text="The OGD is considered the most important department of the Korean Workers Party Central Committee."/>
						<outline text="It was formed in 1946 as part of the Department for General Matters of the KWP."/>
						<outline text="It focuses on four main areas: affairs related to the KWP headquarter, matters related to the North Korean army, administrative matters, and party matters."/>
						<outline text="The military desk was formed by Kim Jong-il in the 1980s as the North Korean military grew."/>
						<outline text="Kim Jong-il succeeded his uncle Kim Yong-ju as department director in 1974, but never officially left his post, so it was succeeded by the first deputy director after his death."/>
						<outline text="The first deputy director was Kim Jong-un's uncle Jang Sung-taek, who led the organization until his execution in December."/>
						<outline text="It is currently led by Jang Sung-taek's wife, Kim Kyong-hui, though several reports have speculated that she may be either dead or in a vegetative state."/>
						<outline text="The OGD expanded so much in power and influence under Kim Jong-il that party bureaucrats refer to it as the ''party within the party."/>
						<outline text="Only the very elite those proven to be the most loyal to the regime are permitted to work in the OGD."/>
						<outline text="The OGD's current first vice directors are Cho Yon-jun, Min Byong-chol, and Kim Kyong-ok. Most pundits are not familiar with them, but they are the link between Kim Jong-un and second and third tier leadership. In other words, they are the power behind the throne."/>

						<outline text="Marc RichPhoto by Guido Roeoesli/AFP/Getty Images"/>
						<outline text="Crime is Slate's crime blog. Like us on Facebook, and follow us on Twitter @slatecrime."/>
						<outline text="Marc Rich, the man who got away with it, died last week, and I would be remiss if I let his death pass without comment. Rich became internationally notorious in 2001, when, as a fugitive from justice, he was pardoned by Bill Clinton in the last hours of his administration. What many don't recall is that Attorney General Eric Holder, who was then a deputy attorney general, was instrumental in securing Rich's pardon."/>
						<outline text="Rich was a pioneering commodities trader who made billions dealing in oil and other goods. He had a habit of dealing with nations with which trade was embargoed, like Iran, Libya, Cuba, and apartheid South Africa. Rich also had a habit of not paying his taxes, to the point where one observer said that ''Marc Rich is to asset concealment what Babe Ruth was to baseball.'' The United States indicted Rich in 1983, hitting him with charges'--tax evasion, wire fraud, racketeering, trading with the enemy'--that could've brought life in prison. Rich fled the country."/>
						<outline text="He remained at large for almost 20 years. (Rich's obituaries have said that, for much of that time, he was on the FBI 10 Most Wanted List, a claim that I have not been able to independently verify. A Lexis-Nexis database search reveals nothing; a call to the FBI's press office was not fruitful.) Rich lived in a big house in Switzerland and spent lots of money trying to make the charges against him go away, giving money to American politicians and to various Israeli causes, motivated at least partly in the latter case by the hope that officials in Israel might petition the United States on his behalf."/>
						<outline text="Finally, in 2000, he saw some return on his efforts. Eric Holder was the key man. As deputy AG, Holder was in charge of advising the president on the merits of various petitions for pardon. Jack Quinn, a lawyer for Rich, approached Holder about clemency for his client. Quinn was a confidant of Al Gore, then a candidate for president; Holder had ambitions of being named attorney general in a Gore administration. A report from the House Committee on Government Reform on the Rich debacle later concluded that Holder must have decided that cooperating in the Rich matter could pay dividends later on."/>
						<outline text="Rich was an active fugitive, a man who had used his money to evade the law, and presidents do not generally pardon people like that. What's more, the Justice Department opposed the pardon'--or would've, if it had known about it. But Holder and Quinn did an end-around, bringing the pardon to Clinton directly and avoiding any chance that Justice colleagues might give negative input. As the House Government Reform Committee report later put it, ''Holder failed to inform the prosecutors under him that the Rich pardon was under consideration, despite the fact that he was aware of the pardon effort for almost two months before it was granted.''"/>
						<outline text="On Jan. 19, 2001, Holder advised the White House that he was ''neutral leaning favorable'' on pardoning Rich. But the U.S. pardon attorney, Roger Adams, needed to sign the pardon, too, and a background check needed to be done. The White House waited to contact Adams until slightly after midnight on Jan. 20, hours before Clinton would leave office. Here's how a recent American Thinker piece described the scene:"/>
						<outline text="Adams would be required to sign the pardons, and when he was informed by White House staff that night, a perfunctory check was done. Adams was stunned to learn that Rich and [Rich's partner Pincus] Green were both fugitives. He tracked down Holder and called him at his home at 1 a.m. that morning."/>
						<outline text="Adams informed Holder that Clinton was giving serious consideration to pardoning the two fugitives. Holder told Adams that he was aware of that fact, and the conversation abruptly ended. "/>
						<outline text="Later that day, Rich's pardon went through."/>
						<outline text="Since then, Bill Clinton hasn't stopped apologizing for the pardons of Marc Rich and Pincus Green. ''It was terrible politics. It wasn't worth the damage to my reputation,'' he told Newsweek in 2002'--and, indeed, speculation was rampant that Rich (and his ex-wife) had bought the pardon by, in part, donating $450,000 to Clinton's presidential library. Clinton denied that the donations had anything to do with the pardon, instead claiming that he took Holder's advice on the matter. Holder, for his part, has distanced himself from the pardons as well. As the House Government Reform Committee report put it, he claimed that his support for the pardon ''was the result of poor judgment, initially not recognizing the seriousness of the Rich case, and then, by the time that he recognized that the pardon was being considered, being distracted by other matters.''"/>
						<outline text="The excuses are weak. In the words of the committee report, ''it is difficult to believe that Holder's judgment would be so monumentally poor that he could not understand how he was being manipulated by Jack Quinn.'' And presidential pardons don't just slip through like this, especially not pardons of wanted fugitives. If Holder had followed protocols and made sure the Justice Department was looped in, there's no way that Rich would have been pardoned. Hundreds of thousands of men sit in American prisons doing unconscionably long sentences for nonviolent drug offenses. DNA tests routinely turn up cases of unjust convictions. But Marc Rich bought his pardon with money and access, and the committee's response to that purchase is worth quoting in full:"/>
						<outline text="The President abused one his most important powers, meant to free the unjustly convicted or provide forgiveness to those who have served their time and changed their lives. Instead, he offered it up to wealthy fugitives whose money had already enabled them to permanently escape American justice. Few other abuses could so thoroughly undermine public trust in government."/>
						<outline text="But there was no real lasting damage to trust in government, or to anyone's reputation, really. Bill Clinton retired to wealth and adulation. Eric Holder got his wish and eventually became attorney general. And Marc Rich died a wealthy man in Switzerland. He never came back to the United States'--if he had returned, he would have been subject to civil suits, which would have ended up costing him money'--but he was able to live out the rest of his life without having to worry about being arrested, having bought his freedom from craven politicians who were only too willing to sell."/>

						<outline text="The European Investment Bank (EIB) is providing a further EUR 200 million loan to the Turkish Government for the Marmaray project, the first rail connection between the European and Asian networks across the Bosphorus Strait."/>
						<outline text="In a public ceremony held in Turkish capital Ankara on Thursday, Turkey's Undersecretary of the Treasury, Ibrahim anakci, and EIB Vice-President responsible for Turkey, Pim van Ballekom, signed the finance agreement."/>
						<outline text="Ballekom said he is pleased to sign this loan agreement, bringing further EIB support for this flagship project linking Europe with Asia. &quot;This facility further consolidates the position of the EIB as Turkey's key financial partner for the financing of large priority projects and the country's efforts to re-balance its transport mode mix in favour of the railways. As the EU bank, we have been a solid partner of Turkey for some fifty years. In 2013 we provided a total of EUR 2.3 billion in Turkey. Our presence here today underlines our commitment to strengthening growth and innovation in Turkey. I am convinced we will continue providing substantial funds to Turkey, continuing our support in our three key spheres of activity: infrastructure, SMEs and corporate lending,&quot; he added."/>
						<outline text="The Marmaray tunnel itself was inaugurated on the occasion of the 90th anniversary of the Republic of Turkey in October last year. Significant works are ongoing to upgrade the surface lines feeding into the already completed tunnel sections. These surface sections on either side of the Bosphorus consist of a 63 kilometer rail line and 37 stations in total. The project was first financed by the EIB in 2004. With the additional EUR 200 million, the EIB's total support for Marmaray now amounts to EUR 1.25 billion."/>
						<outline text="The project consists of connecting the two railway lines on Pan-European Transport Corridor IV, currently terminating on either side of the Bosphorus, through a tunnel. It also joins with the high speed railway between the country's two largest cities, also financed by the EIB. In this way it enables train connections between the two continents. Its merits include significant time gains for the inhabitants of the metropolitan Istanbul area, as well as for travelers, supporting economic development and improving the quality of life while generating significant environmental benefits, the European Commission said in a press release."/>
						<outline text="The Marmaray tunnel is a flagship project of crucial importance for the integration of Turkey with the European Union and the development of the Union's transport network. It is not only one of the largest and most important infrastructure projects to be undertaken so far in Turkey, it is also providing a stimulus to the Turkish and European economies. It is a good example of the catalytic role the EIB can play in helping to co-finance major trans-European network (TENs) infrastructure projects."/>
						<outline text="The project constitutes a key element of the Turkish government's plans to increase the share of rail transport by improving the productivity and effectiveness of railway operations."/>

						<outline text="Press Release No. 14/189April 30, 2014The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved a two-year Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) for Ukraine. The arrangement amounts to SDR 10.976 billion (about US$17.01 billion, 800 percent of quota) and was approved under the Fund's exceptional access policy. The authorities' economic program supported by the Fund aims to restore macroeconomic stability, strengthen economic governance and transparency, and launch sound and sustainable economic growth, while protecting the most vulnerable."/>
						<outline text="The approval of the SBA enables the immediate disbursement of SDR 2.058 billion (about US$3.19 billion), with SDR 1.29 billion (about US$2 billion) being allocated to budget support. The second and third disbursements will be based on bi-monthly reviews and performance criteria, and the remainder of the program period will be subject to standard quarterly reviews and performance criteria."/>
						<outline text="Following the Executive Board's discussion, Ms. Christine Lagarde, Managing Director and Chair, said:"/>
						<outline text="''Deep-seated vulnerabilities'--together with political shocks'--have led to a major crisis in Ukraine. The economy is in recession, fiscal balances have deteriorated, and the financial sector is under significant stress."/>
						<outline text="''Showing unprecedented resolve, the authorities have developed a bold economic program to secure macroeconomic and financial stability and address long-standing imbalances and structural weaknesses to lay a firm foundation for high and sustainable growth. The program focuses on (i) maintaining a flexible exchange rate to restore competitiveness; (ii) stabilizing the financial system; (iii) gradually reducing the unaffordable fiscal deficit; (iv) eliminating losses in the energy sector, while enhancing social safety nets; and (v) decisively breaking with problematic past governance practices."/>
						<outline text="''Following the floating of the hryvnia, the authorities are committed to maintaining a flexible exchange rate regime and focusing monetary policy on domestic price stability. With Fund technical assistance, they plan to adopt inflation targeting by mid-2015."/>
						<outline text="''The authorities are determined to stabilize the financial system, maintain confidence in banks, and strengthen balance sheets and financial regulation and supervision. To this end, they have launched diagnostic studies of the largest banks and started reforms which are critical to restore confidence and stem deposit outflows."/>
						<outline text="''Recognizing the need for fiscal consolidation, the authorities have put in place a package of revenue enhancements and expenditure restraints. Over the program horizon, they target a structural fiscal adjustment of 2 percent of GDP, which will appropriately balance the need to keep public debt on a sustainable path while minimizing the adjustment costs to the economy. To preserve competiveness, the authorities also aim to keep the minimum wage and public wage growth in line with productivity."/>

To this end, they have embarked on the path of meaningful, broad-based, and sustained gas and heating increases over several years, starting from May 2014. Enhancing social assistance to protect the most vulnerable from energy price adjustments is a crucial element of the reforms. In this context, it is important to reach an early agreement on repayment of accumulated arrears and the gas price dispute with Gazprom to prevent disruptions in energy trade between Russia and Ukraine."/>
						<outline text="''A strong and comprehensive structural reform package is critical to reduce corruption, improve the business climate, and achieve high and sustainable growth. The authorities have already enacted a new public procurement law, reducing room for misuse of public resources. They have begun addressing governance issues in state-owned companies and are seeking recovery of stolen assets. They are also planning to build capacity to more effectively conduct enforcement of anti-money laundering and anti-corruption legislation, as well as enhance the effectiveness of the judiciary and tax administration."/>
						<outline text="''Risks to the program are high. In particular, further escalation of tensions with Russia and unrest in the east of the country pose a substantial risk to the economic outlook. Steady and rigorous implementation of policy measures, while maintaining broad public support, will be critical for the program's success and would unlock sizable international official assistance and private capital inflows. The authorities' program is an appropriate response to present challenges and constraints and deserves strong support.''"/>

						<outline text="Recent economic developments"/>
						<outline text="Inconsistent macroeconomic policies pursued in recent years aggravated deep-seated vulnerabilities that made the economy susceptible to economic and political shocks and led to the second major economic crisis in six years. The pegged and overvalued exchange rate led to a deterioration of competitiveness and slower export growth. Together with a rising fiscal deficit and sizeable losses in the energy sector, this drove the current account deficit to over 9 percent of GDP in 2013 and slowed economic growth. Public debt rose to 41 percent of GDP, while external debt remained elevated at 79 percent of GDP. With significant external payments and restricted access to international debt markets, international reserves fell to a critically low level of around two months of imports."/>
						<outline text="In a first important break with past policies, with mounting pressures on the hryvnia and reserves at a critically low level, the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) allowed the exchange rate to float in February. This change in the exchange rate regime, along with increased emergency financing to the budget and the banking system, helped stabilize financial markets. Nonetheless, the economic and political environment remains uncertain. Economic activity is contracting, and international debt markets are closed. The fiscal situation is challenging, as government revenues have fallen on the back of political uncertainty and weak economic performance. The political situation in some regions of the country remains tense. Early presidential elections are scheduled for May 25, 2014."/>
						<outline text="Program Summary"/>
						<outline text="The authorities' economic reform program aims to restore macroeconomic stability, strengthen economic governance and transparency, and launch sound and sustainable economic growth while protecting the vulnerable groups in society. The program will focus on reforms in the following key areas: monetary and exchange rate policies; financial sector; fiscal policies; energy sector; and governance, transparency, and the business climate."/>
						<outline text="Monetary policy will focus on domestic price stability while maintaining a flexible exchange rate regime. To this end, the authorities will initially adopt a money-based monetary framework. With IMF technical assistance, the authorities plan on adopting inflation targeting by mid-2015."/>
						<outline text="Financial sector reforms will aim to maintain confidence in the financial system and strengthen the infrastructure for financial regulation and supervision. Assisted by independent diagnostic studies, the NBU will assess bank resilience to economic shocks and ensure that banks strengthen their balance sheets as necessary. In addition, the authorities will review and upgrade the regulatory and supervisory framework, and take steps to facilitate restructuring of banks' non-performing loans (NPLs)."/>
						<outline text="Fiscal policy will seek to meet near-term spending obligations and gradually reduce the fiscal deficit over the medium-term. The authorities have already put in place a package of measures to stabilize revenue and start on a medium-term expenditure adjustment path that distributed the burden equitably. For 2015''16, further gradual expenditure-based fiscal adjustment'--proceeding at a pace matching the economy's speed of recovery'--will aim to reduce the fiscal deficit to about 3 percent of GDP by 2016."/>
						<outline text="Energy sector reforms will focus on reducing the sector's fiscal drag and enhancing its efficiency and transparency. The objective to bring Naftogaz's deficit to zero by 2018 will be accomplished by policies to raise its revenue and reduce costs. To this end, gradual, but meaningful and broad-based increases in the very low gas and heating retail tariffs will be accompanied by enhanced social assistance measures to mitigate the impact on the poorest. Structural and governance reforms in Naftogaz will improve its governance and reduce operational costs."/>
						<outline text="Reforms to strengthen governance, enhance transparency, and improve the business climate will be critical elements of the program. Policy measures in these areas will include capacity building to reform public procurement and tax administration, strengthen anti-money laundering activities, and fight corruption. These measures will help improve the business climate and alleviate long-standing barriers to growth in Ukraine."/>
						<outline text="In the current difficult environment, real GDP is expected to contract by about 5 percent in 2014 amid weak investor and consumer confidence. Inflation is expected to spike temporarily in response to the exchange rate depreciation and gas and heating tariff increases, reaching 16 percent at end-2014. The current account deficit should fall to about 4½ percent of GDP on the back of the exchange rate adjustment and subdued domestic demand. Replenished by international assistance, gross international reserves will stabilize at around 2½ months of import coverage. The currency devaluation and official borrowing (to help finance a still-wide government deficit) are expected to push public sector debt up to 57 percent of GDP and external debt to just below 100 percent of GDP."/>
						<outline text="Ukraine's economic prospects will improve in the medium-term. Real GDP growth is expected to rebound to 2 percent in 2015, rising to 4-4½ percent in the medium term. The unemployment rate, which reacts to economic recovery with a lag, will gradually decline from 8½ percent in 2014 to 7½ percent by 2016. Buoyed by the restored competitiveness, exports are projected to grow by over 6 percent a year in 2015''16. By end-2016, inflation will fall to about 6 percent and the NBU will build its international reserves to cover nearly 4 months of imports."/>

						<outline text=""/>
						<outline text="While much of the world was distracted by the supposed clash over Ukraine between Russian strongman Vladimir Putin and Western politicians, the International Monetary Fund announced a bailout of the new Ukrainian regime denominated in the IMF's increasingly influential proto-global currency known as Special Drawing Rights, or SDRs. Analysts are warning that the developments could have profound implications for the global monetary system and the economy '-- and especially for the United States, which is stealthily being set up for economic calamity as the U.S. dollar continues on the road to losing its prized status as the world reserve currency."/>
						<outline text="The controversial planetary entity and its Western apparatchiks, along with various communist and socialist dictatorships and the United Nations, have long been agitating to ultimately dethrone the embattled U.S. dollar. Top-level American officials at the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve have been helping them along. The dollar's place as the global reserve currency would be filled by the IMF's SDR, currently composed of a basket of currencies that includes dollars, British pounds, euros, and Japanese yen. The IMF, the UN, and multiple national governments have all openly advocated precisely such a plot in reports and statements made in recent years. The Obama administration, meanwhile, has exploited the Ukraine crisis to further empower the IMF while reducing U.S. influence. "/>
						<outline text="In bailing out the new Ukrainian government, the IMF announcement of its decision '-- taken with approval from Russian authorities despite the alleged East-West brouhaha '-- referred to SDRs on multiple occasions. The press release noted that the IMF board had agreed to a two-year ''Stand-By Arrangement'' that ''amounts to SDR 10.976 billion (about US$17.01 billion, 800 percent of quota).'' The approval under the Fund's ''exceptional access policy,'' the statement said, ''enables the immediate disbursement of SDR 2.058 billion (about US$3.19 billion), with SDR 1.29 billion (about US$2 billion) being allocated to budget support.''"/>
						<outline text="It is not the first time the IMF has relied on SDRs, which were originally created in 1969, for bailing out governments that agree to its demands. Iceland, for example, was also bailed out by the IMF amid the financial crisis with loans denominated in SDRs, which the Fund uses as its &quot;unit of account.&quot; However, the move in Ukraine has attracted the attention of prominent analysts including currency expert and best-selling author Jim Rickards, as well as Robert Wenzel, editor of the Economic Policy Journal. ''The U.S. has never really stopped promoting SDRs as a global currency,'' Wenzel noted. ''Now Ukraine is being bailed out with this global government souped up money.''"/>
						<outline text="In an e-mail to The New American, Wenzel noted that during the recent financial crisis, IMF allocations of SDRs occurred in 2009 and 2011 to various countries. ''But what is noteworthy about those distributions is that China voiced its displeasure at the measures,'' he said, citing comments made by the chairman of the People's Bank of China, Zhou Xiaochuan. ''It highlights the legitimate concern of the Chinese that the U.S., because of its major influence at the IMF, is trying to promote the SDR as an alternative to the dollar.''"/>
						<outline text="''The payment to Ukraine in SDRs should be viewed as another move in this direction,'' Wenzel added. ''It signals fear on the part of U.S. government officials that the dollar is slowly losing its luster as a reserve currency. U.S. officials are trying to nudge the SDR as the alternative to the dollar because they will still maintain significant influence with regard to the SDR, as opposed to some other currency taking hold in parts of the world as a reserve currency (the [Chinese] renminbi?) or gold returning as an important reserve. China and Russia are both presently accumulating gold.''"/>
						<outline text="Other analysts have also pointed to the latest IMF move as significant. Writing in Personal Liberty Digest, Alternative Market Project founder Brandon Smith suggested that the supposed bickering between East and West is largely theater for public consumption. Noting that like the U.S. government, Russian authorities are also dominated by global banks, Smith said that what is happening with the Ukraine bailout is part of the quiet but open move toward replacing the U.S. dollar with a global fiat currency such as the SDR.   "/>
						<outline text="''The SDR will not immediately be issued as a commonly traded currency itself,'' he said. ''Rather, the IMF will take over management of included currencies and denominate those currencies using SDR valuations. For example, $1 U.S. is worth only .64 SDR today. In the near future, I expect that the dollar will plummet in relation to the SDR's value. We will still have our greenbacks when the IMF begins administrating our currency system, but the international and domestic worth of those greenbacks will fall to pennies. In turn, other currencies with stronger economic positions will rise in worth relative to the SDR.'' "/>
						<outline text="Indeed, since the financial crisis began, the SDR, described by the IMF as an ''international reserve asset,'' has taken on a far greater role in the global economic system. In fact, according to an IMF ''Fact sheet'' posted on its website in March, the amount of fiat SDRs in existence mushroomed by an unprecedented ten times in recent years. ''With a general SDR allocation that took effect on August 28 and a special allocation on September 9, 2009, the amount of SDRs increased from SDR 21.4 billion to around SDR 204 billion (equivalent to about $316 billion, converted using the rate of March 12, 2014),'' the IMF said."/>
						<outline text="In a 2009 statement announcing the conjuring of drastically more SDRs into existence, the Fund said it was meant ''to provide liquidity to the global economic system by supplementing Fund's member countries' foreign exchange reserves.'' The IMF did not respond to e-mails and a spokesperson was not willing to go on record about SDRs, but it seems that the international outfit has been creating its own ''liquidity'' '-- redeemable in U.S. dollars or other fiat currencies in the SDR basket '-- out of thin air. It was not clear if there was a limit to how much ''liquidity'' the Fund could theoretically emit. In other words, the IMF is increasingly becoming more like a central bank. "/>
						<outline text="Even before the IMF stepped in to bail out Ukraine with SDRs, various actors were considering doing something similar on their own. Since at least early last year, transnational entities and national governments have been discussing the use of the IMF's would-be new world currency to prop up Ukraine's fledgling regime. In December, top Russian officials, for example, were plotting a $15 billion bailout to be paid in the global ''asset'' created by the Fund. ''We are now also discussing a loan in the form of SDRs,'' Russian ''Prime Minister'' Dmitry Medvedev was quoted as telling journalists before the whole deal with the former Ukrainian regime fell through."/>
						<outline text="Even the Communist Chinese dictatorship has been advocating the creation of a new world currency managed by the IMF. In a 2009 report published on the central bank's website entitled ''Reform the International Monetary System,'' for example, the ''people's'' central-bank boss Xiaochuan explained that ''the desirable goal of reforming the international monetary system, therefore, is to create an international reserve currency that is disconnected from individual nations and is able to remain stable in the long run, thus removing the inherent deficiencies caused by using credit-based national currencies.'' The rest of the BRICS regimes are also openly working toward that goal."/>
						<outline text="Under the explicitly outlined globalist vision, the IMF would serve as the planetary central bank '-- complete with the ability to fleece humanity by conjuring fiat currency into existence at interest like other privately owned central banks around the world, such as the U.S. Federal Reserve. With the SDR-denominated bailout of Kiev, along with the growing influence and amount of the IMF's proto-global currency, analysts say that mission is another step closer to being accomplished. That would be a disaster for the world '-- and especially for Americans."/>

						<outline text="New evidence culled from a court case involving CIA contractors has revealed flight paths through Djibouti that appear to indicate the country's role as a hub of the CIA's rendition network in Africa, according to documents released by the U.K.-based human rights group Reprieve and New York University's Global Justice Clinic."/>
						<outline text="The documents could support the case of Mohammad al-Asad, a former CIA detainee who is suing the government of Djibouti for its alleged role in hosting CIA ''black sites'' '-- specifically the one where he says he was detained and tortured for two weeks between December 2003 and January 2004. A Senate investigation into the agency's ''detention and interrogation program'' had previously confirmed that several individuals had in fact been detained in Djibouti, according to two officials who read the still-classified report and spoke to Al Jazeera."/>
						<outline text="Investigators behind the document release combed through contracts, invoices and letters put into evidence for a court case '-- which involved CIA contractors and was separate from the Djibouti allegations '-- and pieced together a series of rendition circuits, or flight paths, between 2003 and 2004. They include legs through Djibouti '-- even though the Horn of Africa did not appear to be a convenient stopover between the United States and Afghanistan, the circuits' endpoints."/>
						<outline text="''Djibouti was not on the way, it was a destination,'' said Margaret Satterthwaite, al-Asad's attorney and a professor at the Global Justice Clinic. ''That's kind of a telltale sign of a rendition circuit.''"/>
						<outline text="The evidence also implicated private companies '-- including Computer Sciences Corp. (CSC), DynCorp Systems and Solutions (which was purchased by CSC in 2003 and later divested), Richmor Aviation and First Flight '-- in the Africa rendition program for the first time."/>
						<outline text="''These documents provide further evidence of how U.S. corporations played a crucial role in the CIA's torture network, rendering people to torture around the world far from public scrutiny and even further from the rule of law,'' said Kevin Lo, corporate social responsibility advocate at Reprieve."/>
						<outline text="A spokesman for Computer Sciences Corp. said his company did not comment on &quot;speculation about its clients or their activities&quot; but added in an email to Al Jazeera: &quot;CSC has had the privilege for over fifty years of supporting governments and private sector organizations worldwide, and has done so within the law.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="Richmor Aviation and First Flight did not respond to Al Jazeera's requests for comment in time for publication."/>

In an exclusive interview with Al Jazeera, al-Asad, who is now 54 years old, said he was taken from his home in Tanzania to Djibouti, where he was detained for two weeks. He was then rendered to Afghanistan, where he says he was tortured at various points over the course of more than a year at several CIA black site prisons."/>

						<outline text="A Pakistani official on Thursday slammed the CIA's fake vaccination drive in 2011 for fueling distrust of polio eradication campaigns and driving ''attacks on polio workers'' as the country grapples with an outbreak of this highly infectious disease that is spiraling into a global emergency."/>
						<outline text="Speaking to reporters at a press briefing, a spokesperson for Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs took direct aim at the CIA's false vaccination campaign, which was conducted as part of the hunt for Osama Bin Ladin and exposed by the Guardian in 2011."/>
						<outline text="''A fake campaign of vaccination was conducted in Pakistan in which the [International NGOs] were also used,'' said the spokesperson, according to a transcript from the Pakistani government.

Local opposition to vaccination efforts remains a key barrier to broad administration of the vaccine."/>

''If the incident in Abbottabad did not happen, and these rumors didn't spread to us, we would have continued the vaccinations as we had been,'' he said."/>

						<outline text="Lobbyist Sir Alan Parker has been trying to influence the decision to allow the hostile takeover of AstraZeneca by US giant Pfizer"/>
						<outline text="A lobbyist friend of David Cameron is at the heart of the hostile bid by American drugs giant Pfizer to take over British rival AstraZeneca, it emerged yesterday."/>
						<outline text="Sir Alan Parker, who once holidayed with Mr Cameron and received a knighthood in the New Year honours list, is spearheading the UK lobbying operation for Pfizer's controversial £63'billion bid."/>
						<outline text="Mr Cameron has been accused of 'cheerleading' for the bid, despite concerns about the impact on British jobs and science."/>
						<outline text="Last night Downing Street said it was 'nonsense' to suggest the Prime Minister's friendship with Sir Alan had coloured his view of the proposed deal."/>
						<outline text="'The Prime Minister is fighting for British jobs and British science,' the spokesman said."/>
						<outline text="But the revelations will raise fresh concerns about the influence of well-connected lobbyists within government. Sir Alan, whose PR and lobbying firm Brunswick is acting for Pfizer, has close personal links with Mr Cameron."/>
						<outline text="The Prime Minister was guest of honour at his 50th birthday and the two men's families have been on holiday together."/>
						<outline text="Sir Alan accompanied Mr Cameron on a trade mission to China in December last year and he was knighted a few weeks later."/>
						<outline text="Tory sources pointed out that Sir Alan, whose firm acted for US food giant Kraft in its bitter 2009 take-over of British chocolate maker  Cadbury, also had close links to Gordon Brown. Brunswick declined to comment."/>
						<outline text="The revelations came amid mounting concern about the potential impact of a foreign buyout of AstraZeneca."/>
						<outline text="The Wellcome Trust, Britain's biggest medical research foundation, became the latest high-profile organisation to warn that the deal could damage Britain's science and research base."/>
						<outline text=" "/>
						<outline text="Sir Alan is a personal friend of British Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured"/>
						<outline text="In a leaked letter to George Osborne, trust chairman Sir William Castell said the deal raised 'major concerns'. He said AstraZeneca was 'critical' to the UK's science base and he raised doubts about Pfizer's record."/>
						<outline text="'Pfizer's past acquisitions of major pharmaceutical companies have led to a substantial reduction in research and development activity, which we are concerned could be replicated in this instance,' Sir William said."/>
						<outline text="Mr Cameron, who has held talks with both sides in the deal, has already extracted a series of assurances from Pfizer about future investment in the UK."/>
						<outline text="But last week he said he wanted further assurances, and officials are examining how to make any promises binding."/>
						<outline text="Nick Clegg yesterday warned that the Government's massive spending on pharmaceuticals and science gave it a 'stake' in the outcome of the deal which justified interference '' including demanding assurances on jobs and research."/>
						<outline text="Swedish premier Fredrik Reinfeldt yesterday said Pfizer's promises could not be trusted. Sweden was given assurances by the  US firm during its 2002 acquisition of Pharmacia but Mr Reinfeldt said:  'There were promises that it would mean jobs and operations in Sweden that we don't think were honoured.'"/>
						<outline text="Ed Miliband was accused of 'a huge error of judgment' yesterday after it emerged he had rejected talks with Pfizer about its planned takeover of AstraZeneca."/>
						<outline text="Labour sources confirmed that Mr Miliband had turned down a meeting with Pfizer boss Ian Read because he was 'too busy' '' just days before he attacked the deal."/>
						<outline text="Labour leader Ed Miliband was heavily criticised for refusing to meet Pfizer boss Ian Read because he was 'too busy'"/>
						<outline text="The Labour leader was also facing the prospect of a Commons sleaze inquiry over a donation of £4,400 from former Labour minister Shriti Vadera when she was a board member of AstraZeneca last year. Mr Miliband failed to draw attention to it, as required by parliamentary rules, when he criticised the Pfizer deal in the Commons."/>
						<outline text="Leading Conservatives yesterday accused Mr Miliband of 'posturing' and said it was extraordinary that  he chose to hit the election trail rather than discuss the potential fallout of the biggest takeover in British corporate history."/>
						<outline text="David Cameron, who has held talks with both sides in the deal, said his policy of engagement stood in 'stark contrast to the Labour leader who wouldn't even meet with them'. Chancellor George Osborne added: 'It is a huge error of judgment.'"/>

							<outline text="Pakistan's Foreign Ministry has issued a statement today angrily lashing the World Health Organization (WHO) for pushing travel restrictions against their country over a polio outbreak, noting a phony vaccination program the UN organization was involved in was the source of the outbreak."/>
							<outline text="''A fake campaign of vaccination was conducted in Pakistan in which the UN agencies were also used. I am referring to the Dr. Shakeel Afridi case,'' noted the spokeswoman, adding ''this further reinforced the negative perception about the agenda behind the polio eradication campaign.''"/>
							<outline text="Dr. Afridi operated a phony vaccination program in early 2011 on behalf of the CIA, and with tacit support from the WHO. Instead of vaccinating children against polio, they were collecting the DNA of children to look for relatives of terrorists. The program led to the death of Osama bin Laden."/>
							<outline text="The cost was enormous, however, as the revelation of the program forced aid agencies whose names were falsely tied to the fiasco to withdraw from the country, and had many fearing that polio vaccination programs after Afridi's arrest were also suspect."/>
							<outline text="Pakistan's Foreign Ministry says the WHO's obsession with ''single vaccination'' programs that only ensure Pakistani children get the polio vaccination, while ignoring many others that are just as important, has also fueled conspiracy theories about why only the one vaccination is being pushed, and militant attacks on vaccination workers has added to that speculation."/>

						<outline text="Vulnerability: Expert testimony before Congress on Thursday warned that an electromagnetic pulse attack on our power grid and electronic infrastructure could leave most Americans dead and the U.S. in another century."/>
						<outline text="That dire warning came from Peter Vincent Pry, a member of the Congressional EMP Commission and executive director of the Task Force on National and Homeland Security."/>
						<outline text="He testified in front of the House Homeland Security Committee's Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection and Security Technologies that an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) event could wipe out 90% of America's population."/>
						<outline text="Most people's eyes might glaze over upon mention of the committee name, the title of the hearing '-- &quot;Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP): Threat to Critical Infrastructure&quot; '-- and the general subject of EMP. But it is a real threat and not the stuff of science fiction."/>
						<outline text="Some attention has been paid to the potential cataclysmic effects of a natural phenomenon such as a massive solar storm, an event that has occurred in America's horse-and-buggy era when it did not matter."/>
						<outline text="Today an electromagnetic pulse event would be devastating. It wouldn't need a solar storm, just a solitary nuke detonated in the atmosphere above the American heartland. We would envy the horse-and-buggy era."/>
						<outline text="&quot;Natural EMP from a geomagnetic superstorm, like the 1859 Carrington Event or 1921 Railroad Storm, and nuclear EMP attack from terrorists or rogue states, as practiced by North Korea during the nuclear crisis of 2013, are both existential threats that could kill 9-of-10 Americans through starvation, disease and societal collapse,&quot; the Washington Free Beacon quoted Pry as saying."/>
						<outline text="As we reported early last year, Pry, a former CIA nuclear weapons analyst, believes that North Korea's recent seemingly low-yield nuclear tests and launch of a low-orbit satellite may in fact be preparations for a future electromagnetic pulse attack."/>
						<outline text="A copy of a report prepared by the Department of Homeland Security for the Defense Department, obtained by Pry from sources within DHS, finds North Korea could use its Unha-3 space launch vehicle to deliver a nuclear warhead as a satellite over the South Pole to attack America from the south."/>
						<outline text="As the Heritage Foundation has reported, an EMP attack with a warhead detonated 25 to 300 miles above the U.S. mainland &quot;would fundamentally change the world:&quot;"/>
						<outline text="&quot;Airplanes would fall from the sky; most cars would be inoperable; electrical devices would fail. Water, sewer and electrical networks would fail simultaneously. Systems of banking, energy, transportation, food production and delivery, water, emergency services and even cyberspace would collapse.&quot;"/>

						<outline text="&quot;Negotiations only work if you have got something to exchange,&quot; he said."/>
						<outline text="Mr Lewin added: &quot;What the problem really is, is that there's a very grave lack of infrastructure in terms of intelligence in terms of capability on the part of the Nigerian government in the region of the country where these extremists are active."/>

						<outline text="Speaking for more than thirty minutes at the VIP Capital City Club event in Columbia, S.C., he addressed the prominant group of attendees in the key presidential primary state."/>
						<outline text="ADVERTISEMENT"/>
						<outline text="In recent months, the vice president has focused on revving up liberals on issues of income inequality, as he prepares for a possible run against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, though many Democrats don't think he'd run against her.Biden did not mention his own presidential ambitions Friday, but multiple sources described his speech as &quot;populist&quot; and high-energy, according to CNN. One attendee said it was an &quot;Elizabeth Warren-type speech&quot; blasting income inequality."/>
						<outline text="&quot;He said we have some of the most productive workers in the world, but corporations are more concerned about their stockholders than they are about their employees,&quot; one attendee said. &quot;He talked about how the fruits of labor go to stockholders, rather than to the people who are producing it. That the people making the money in this country are the corporations.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="Another attendee described it as &quot;a stem-winding, almost revival-type speech.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="Biden's rare rebuke of the Clintons' economic policies, which some liberals view as too friendly to Wall Street, indicates how he'd possibly approach a 2016 campaign if he and Clinton square off in a primary."/>

						<outline text="By Mick Krever, CNN"/>
						<outline text="Who controls the Hermit Kingdom?"/>
						<outline text="According to a North Korean defector '' a former regime insider who was one of Kim Jong Il's favorite poet-propagandists '' it is not the 31-year-old dictator Kim Jong Un."/>
						<outline text="''When Kim Jong Il died and Kim Jong Un succeeded him, people saw the transfer of power from father to son,'' Jang Jin-Sung told CNN's Christiane Amanpour in London. ''What they did not see also was what happened to the apparatus of the totalitarian system that supported the rule of Kim Jong Il.''"/>
						<outline text="That apparatus, Jang said, is the Organization and Guidance Department, or OGD '' it was Kim Jong Il's education as he rose through the ranks, and was full of his university friends."/>
						<outline text="It is an ''old-boy's network'' made into a massive surveillance organization."/>
						<outline text="''Kim Jong Il had the OGD as his old boys' network,'' Jang told Amanpour. ''Kim Jong-un may have friends in his Swiss school, but he has no one inside North Korea.''"/>
						<outline text="Jang is the author of a new book, &quot;Dear Leader: Poet, Spy, Escapee '' A Look Inside North Korea.&quot;"/>
						<outline text="''After the execution of Jang Song Thaek [Kim Jong Un's uncle], he has become an orphan '' not just in terms of family connections, but in terms of politics.''"/>
						<outline text="''He's a political orphan.''"/>
						<outline text="Precious little is known about Kim Jong Un, who inherited the leadership of North Korea after his father's death in 2011."/>
						<outline text="Since that time, Jang said, Kim Jong Un has had to rely on his father's ''old-boys network'' to get anything done."/>
						<outline text="But because that group does not respect the younger Kim, who was educated in Switzerland, the way it did his father, Kim Jong Un has become nothing more than the symbolic head of North Korea."/>
						<outline text="Defector: I saw Kim Jong Il as 'divine'Meeting Kim"/>
						<outline text="''Until the day I met Kim Jong Il,'' Jang says, ''I truly considered him divine, as someone more holy, like a sage '' someone to be revered, someone who was better than us, who was sacrificing his own life for the people.''"/>
						<outline text="So effective was the regime propaganda machine, he told Amanpour, that he did not even believe that Kim the elder used the toilet."/>
						<outline text="But Jang, a poet, caught the dictator's eye, and was invited for a private audience with him."/>
						<outline text="''The man I saw standing in front of me was a man, he was a human being. He was not a holy man; he was not a saint; he was not a god. He was a man just like me, who did use the toilet.''"/>
						<outline text="In propaganda, Kim had used ''perfectly composed, flowery language,'' Jang said, and was deeply reverential of ''the people.''"/>
						<outline text="''But when I met him, he just spoke in slang like in a kind of commanding colloquial, working-class slang, even to his most senior men.''"/>
						<outline text="''And that was shocking to me.''"/>
						<outline text="He even, Jang told Amanpour, wore shoes to boost his height."/>
						<outline text="Defector lifts curtain on North KoreaShattering the myth"/>
						<outline text="Once a North Korean has been admitted into the dictator's inner circle, Jang said '' ''after having spent more than twenty minutes with him behind closed doors, at his personal request'' '' the leader's ''divinity'' gets transferred onto that person."/>
						<outline text="''You become immune from all prosecution, all harm. You're protected by his divinity.''"/>
						<outline text="From that highest perch of North Korean society, Jang could clearly see for the first time all the lies he had been told."/>
						<outline text="The truth became even starker when he went back to visit his hometown of Sairwon, in the southwest of the country."/>
						<outline text="''That was when I really witnessed the devastating effects of the famine. That's where I saw the corpses in the station area just piling up and being taken away.''"/>
						<outline text="As many as 3.5 million people are estimated to have died during North Korea's severe famine of the 1990s, according to the South Korean NGO Good Friends Center for Peace, Human Rights, and Refugees. (Official North Korean numbers estimate that 220,000 people died.)"/>
						<outline text="It is also, he told Amanpour, where he saw a public execution."/>
						<outline text="''It is not classified as a punishment in response to a crime. It's considered a method of moral education, of building up society's standards of morality. So that's why these executions happen in public places, such as market squares, where people watch it.''"/>
						<outline text="''It becomes a theater.''"/>
						<outline text="A decade ago Jang decided to flee the country. Not even his family knew he was planning to leave."/>
						<outline text="Had he told them, he told Amanpour, their innocence would have been compromised, and they would have been vulnerable to the wrath of the state security service."/>
						<outline text="Cracking the regime"/>
						<outline text="The most closed country on earth continues to fascinate the world, and among the most discussed questions is if, and how, the brutal regime could fall."/>
						<outline text="''Currently, there are two classes in North Korea locked in battle with each other,'' Jang said."/>
						<outline text="''One I will call the loyal class. This is the class that is invested, that has a stake in this continuation of the status quo, of oppression and surveillance and control.''"/>
						<outline text="''The other class are the market classes,'' he said. ''Their livelihoods are not sustained by the system, but actually oppressed by it.''"/>
						<outline text="Earlier this year, a PBS Frontline documentary featured stunning footage of ordinary North Koreans using free enterprise and challenging regime security officers."/>
						<outline text="North Koreans, the documentary showed, are increasingly exposed to the outside world, through smuggled DVDs and USB sticks containing Western and South Korean movies and TV shows."/>
						<outline text="''In the past, there was only one thing to belong to, one thing that sustained you, one thing that kept your family going'...loyalty to the cult of Kim.''"/>
						<outline text="''But now people have realized finally, after the famine, that it is not loyalty that feeds them. It is money. It is work. It is owning something. It's individual property that feeds one.''"/>
						<outline text="''So loyalty to Kim Il Sung'' '' Kim Jong Un's grandfather '' ''has been trumped by, let's say, the portrait of Washington on a U.S. dollar note.''"/>
						<outline text="Change in North Korea will not come, Jang said, by negotiating with the regime. It will come through knowledge."/>
						<outline text="''Truth will set North Korea free. The people will set North Korea free. The erosion of control will set North Korea free, not engagement with the regime.''"/>

						<outline text=""/>
						<outline text=" By Gabriel Black9 May 2014The US Department of Justice (DOJ) posted a video Monday in which Attorney General Eric Holder sought to dismiss the widely held, and completely justified, belief that the Obama administration treats the major American banks and financial institutions as being above the law. Various newspapers report that the video will be followed by a decision by the DOJ to criminally prosecute two foreign banks for crimes unrelated to the financial crisis."/>
						<outline text="The video and the likely prosecutions are disingenuous PR moves designed to give the public the impression that the Obama administration is tough on the banks. However, this transparent attempt at cover-up and deception is undermined by the reported decision to target only foreign, not US-based, banks."/>
						<outline text="In fact, by going after Credit Suisse Group AG and BNP Paribas SA, the Obama administration is compounding its refusal to prosecute American Wall Street bankers for their criminality and fraud by attacking their overseas rivals."/>
						<outline text="Holder begins his video by declaring: ''There is no such thing as too big to jail.'' He goes on to state that ''some have used that phrase to describe the theory that certain financial institutions, even if they engage in criminal misconduct, should be considered immune to prosecution, due to their sheer size and influence in the economy.''"/>
						<outline text="It is unclear, when Holder refers to ''some,'' if he is referring to himself. In March of 2013, Holder, responding to questioning from Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, who noted that there had been no criminal prosecutions of financial institutions or executives by the Obama administration, said: ''I am concerned that the size of some of these institutions becomes so large that it does become difficult for us to prosecute them, when we are hit with indications that if we do prosecute'--if we do bring a criminal charge'--it will have a negative impact on the national economy, perhaps even the world economy'...''"/>
						<outline text="Holder's testimony before Congress amounted to an admission that the US government does, indeed, consider big US banks and their top executives to be ''above the law,'' and deliberately avoids prosecuting them for illegal activities."/>
						<outline text="In the video's second half, Holder tells the viewer that he ''personally'' is overseeing criminal charges against some major banks. He explains that the DOJ is working closely with the banks and regulators so that the indictments don't cause any undue harm that could potentially hurt the wider economy."/>
						<outline text="Holder is reported to be referring to potential charges against Switzerland's Credit Suisse and France's BNP Paribas. The week, before the DOJ video, was released, the New York Times reported that ''lawyers briefed on the matter'' told them that the Justice Department was poised to file criminal charges against the two banks."/>
						<outline text="BNP is being probed for having financial dealings with Iran, Sudan, and Cuba. Last week the French bank announced that it may face fines exceeding $1.1 billion from the US government for breaking sanction agreements against these and other countries."/>
						<outline text="Credit Suisse will likely be charged with tax evasion. The Swiss bank is alleged to have offered tax shelters for Americans for many years. The bank has already entered into a ''deferred prosecution'' plea bargain with the DOJ. However, the Justice Department is pushing for an actual guilty plea from a subsidiary of the bank."/>
						<outline text="In the Times article, the authors virtually repeat the DOJ's video message, indicating a coordinated public relations effort."/>
						<outline text="The Times writes that ''prosecutors are confronting the popular belief that Wall Street institutions have grown so important to the economy that they cannot be charged,'' and adds that ''prosecutors in Washington and New York have met with regulators about how to criminally punish banks without putting them out of business and damaging the economy.''"/>
						<outline text="Is no accident that the reported charges against the two targeted banks have nothing to do with the fraudulent and illegal activities that played a key role in the financial crash of 2008 and continue to characterize the money-making practices of the major US banks."/>
						<outline text="In the case of BNP Paribas, the charges of sanctions-busting are a reactionary defense of predatory penalties imposed by the US on foreign governments deemed inimical to the world-wide economic and geo-strategic interests of American imperialism."/>
						<outline text="Since the 2008 financial meltdown, an abundance of evidence has confirmed that the major banks have been involved in financial wrongdoings--costing hundreds of millions of people their jobs, homes and savings. No top executive has been criminally charged for these actions."/>
						<outline text="The crimes committed by major financial institutions include:"/>
						<outline text="* Goldman Sachs played a leading criminal role in the selling of mortgage-backed securities. During the height of the financial crisis, it offloaded securities based on toxic sub-prime mortgages to its own customers while simultaneously betting that they would fail. In 2012, the government ended its investigation into Goldman Sachs, despite emails and other records showing criminal actions."/>
						<outline text="Subsequent probes have documented similar activities on the part of JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and other major US banks, without resulting in a criminal indictment of any bank or leading executive."/>
						<outline text="* In 2013, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations released a 300-paged report documenting systematic fraud and deception by JPMorgan Chase, the biggest US bank, in connection with over $6.2 billion in losses from high-risk speculative trades in financial derivatives in 2012. The losses, incurred by the bank's London-based Chief Investment Office and a trader dubbed the ''London whale'' because of the size of his bets, were concealed from investors, analysts, regulators and the public by the bank's top management, including its chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, Obama's ''favorite banker.'' No criminal charges were brought."/>
						<outline text="* Bernard Madoff's multi-billion-dollar pyramid scheme relied on several major banks. Madoff stated in 2013, ''Although I have offered the bankruptcy trustee the information that I possessed that would demonstrate in detail the complicit behavior of banks like JPMorgan, Bank of NY, HSBC, Citicorp'... the trustee seems unwilling to act on my offer.'' JPMorgan is alleged by one Madoff trustee lawsuit to have made over a billion dollars from the pyramid scheme. No charges were brought against the bank, or its chief executive Jamie Dimon."/>
						<outline text="* UBS, Switzerland's largest bank, and Barclays both admitted to rigging the London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor), the benchmark global interest rate to which hundreds of trillions of dollars of financial contracts are tied. Several other banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, all are thought to have done so as well and are under investigation. In the UBS Libor-rigging case, the US Justice Department deliberately chose not to pursue criminal charges against UBS itself. Instead, it extracted a guilty plea on one relatively minor count of wire fraud from the bank's Japanese unit. As the Wall Street Journal reported, ''Justice Department officials said they decided not to charge the Zurich-based company, fearing such a move could endanger its stability.''"/>
						<outline text="* HSBC, the world's third largest bank, and Wachovia both laundered billions of dollars of drug money for Mexican drug cartels. These cartels flood working class neighborhood with cheap narcotics and other addictive drugs, devastating the lives of hundreds of thousands of working poor. Not a single criminal charge was brought against either bank."/>
						<outline text="* Virtually every major US bank was involved in fraudulent processing of home foreclosures in the aftermath of the 2008 crash and recession. Untold numbers of American families were illegally forced out of their homes. In a blanket settlement overseen by the Obama administration, none of the banks or their executives were indicted."/>
